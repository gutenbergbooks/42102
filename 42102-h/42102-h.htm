<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">A TYPICAL BOY SCOUT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Rob; what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Crawford stopped on his way past the
Hampton post-office, and hailed Rob Blake, the
leader of the Eagle Patrol, of which Merritt
was corporal. Both lads wore the natty scout
uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing is up or down, either,&rdquo; rejoined
Rob, with a laugh; &ldquo;it looks as if things had
stopped happening in Hampton ever since that
schooner was blown up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jack Curtiss&rsquo;s hopes of a fortune with
it,&rdquo; added Merritt. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m off home. Going
that way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be with you in a&mdash;&mdash; Hullo, what&rsquo;s
happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From farther up the street, at one end of
which lay the glistening sheet of water known
as Hampton Inlet, there came excited shouts.
Then, suddenly, into the field of vision there
swept, with astonishing rapidity, a startling
sight.</p>
<p>A large automobile was coming toward them
at a rapid rate. On the driver&rsquo;s seat was a white-faced
young girl, a cloud of fair hair streaming
out about her frightened countenance. She was
gripping the steering wheel, and seemed to be
striving desperately to check the onrush of the
machine. But her efforts were vain. The auto,
instead of decreasing its rate of progress, appeared
every minute to be gaining in speed.</p>
<p>It bumped and swayed wildly. A cloud of yellow
dust arose about it. Behind the runaway machine
could be perceived a crowd of townsfolk
shouting incoherently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop it! I shall be killed! Stop it, please
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl was shrilly screaming in
alarm, as the machine approached the two boys.
So rapidly had events progressed since they first
sighted it, that not a word had been exchanged
between them. All at once, Merritt noticed that
he was alone. Rob had darted to the roadway.
As the auto dashed by, Merritt saw the young
leader of the Hampton Boy Scouts give a sudden
flying leap upon the running-board. He shot
up from the road as if a steel spring had projected
him.</p>
<p>For one instant he hung between life and
death&mdash;or, at least, serious injury. The speed
with which the auto was going caused the lad&rsquo;s
legs to fly out from it, as one of his hands caught
the side door of the tonneau. But in a jiffy Rob&rsquo;s
athletic training triumphed. By a supreme effort
he managed to steady himself and secure a grip
with his other hand. Then he rapidly made his
way forward along the running-board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>But this move proved almost disastrous. The
already panic-stricken girl took her attention
from the steering-wheel for an instant. In that
molecule of time, the auto, like a perverse live
thing, got beyond her control. It leaped wildly
toward the sidewalk outside the Hampton candy
store. A crowd of young folks&mdash;it was Saturday
afternoon&mdash;had been indulging in ice cream and
other dainties, when the shouts occasioned by the
runaway machine had alarmed them.</p>
<p>Instantly soda and candy counters were neglected,
and a rush for the sidewalk ensued. But,
as they poured out to see what was the matter,
they were faced by deadly peril.</p>
<p>The auto, like a juggernaut, was careening
straight at them. Its exhausts roared like the
nostrils of an excited beast.</p>
<p>Young girls screamed, and boys tried to drag
them out of harm&rsquo;s way. But had it not been
for the fact that at that instant Rob gained the
wheel, there might have been some serious accidents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>The lad fairly wrenched it out of the hands
of the girl driver, who was half fainting at the
imminence of the peril. A quick, savage twist,
and the car spun round and was on a straight
course again. That danger, at least, was over.
But another, and a deadlier, threatened.</p>
<p>Right ahead lay the spot where the road terminated
in a long wharf, at which occasional steamers
landed. Every second brought them closer
to it. If Rob could not stop the machine before
it reached the end of the wharf, it was bound to
plunge over and into the sea. All this flashed
through the boy&rsquo;s mind as he strove to find some
means of stopping the car. But the auto was of
a type unfamiliar to him. One experiment in
checking its motion resulted instead in a still
more furious burst of speed.</p>
<p>Like objects seen in a nightmare, the stores,
the white faces of the alarmed townsfolk, and
the other familiar objects of the village street,
streaked by in a gray blur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must stop it! I must!&rdquo; breathed Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>But how? Where had the manufacturer of
the car concealed his emergency brake? The
lever controlling it seemed to be mysteriously out
of sight. Suddenly the motion of the car
changed. It no longer bumped. It ran terribly
smoothly and swiftly.</p>
<p>From the street it had passed out upon the
even surface of the planked wharf. Only a few
seconds now in which to gain control of it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The emergency brake!&rdquo; shouted Rob aloud in
his extremity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your foot! It works with your foot, I
think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice, faint as a whisper over a long-distance
telephone, came to the ears of the striving
boy. It belonged to the girl beside him.
Glancing down, Rob now saw what he would
have observed at first, if he had had time to look
about him&mdash;a metal pedal projected through the
floor of the car. With an inward prayer, he
jammed his foot down upon it. Would it work?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The end of the pier was terribly close now.
The water gleamed blue and intense. It seemed
awaiting the fatal plunge overboard.</p>
<p>But that plunge was not taken. There was a
grinding sound, like a harsh purr, the speed of
the car decreased, and, finally, it came to a stop&mdash;just
in time.</p>
<p>From the landward end of the pier a crowd
came running. In front were two or three khaki-uniformed
members of the Eagle Patrol. Behind
them several of the Hawks were mingled
with the crowd.</p>
<p>Beyond all the confusion, Rob, as he turned
his head, could see another automobile coming.
It had two passengers in it. As the crowd surged
about the boy and the girl, who had not yet
alighted, and poured out questions in a rapid fusillade,
the second car came &ldquo;honking&rdquo; up.</p>
<p>A murmur of &ldquo;Mr. Blake&rdquo; ran through the
throng, as a tall, ruddy-faced man descended,
followed by a military-looking gentleman, whose
face was strongly agitated. Mr. Blake was Rob&rsquo;s
father, and, as readers of other volumes of this
series know, the banker and scout patron of the
little community. It was his car in which he had
just driven up with his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>The latter hesitated not a moment, but in a few
long strides gained the side of the car which
Rob&rsquo;s efforts had stopped just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravely done, my lad; bravely done,&rdquo; he cried,
and then, to the girl, &ldquo;good heavens, Alice, what
an experience! Child, you might have been killed
if it had not been for this lad&rsquo;s pluck! Mr.
Blake,&rdquo; as the banker came up, &ldquo;I congratulate
you on your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; rejoined the banker gravely, &ldquo;feel
that I am not egotistical in accepting that congratulation.
Rob, this is my friend, Major
Roger Dangerfield, from up the State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said the major, returning Rob&rsquo;s
salutation and turning to the girl who was clinging
to him, &ldquo;is my daughter, Alice, whose first
experience with the operation of an automobile
nearly came to a disastrous ending.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Rob Blake, whose heroic action has just been
described, was&mdash;as readers of The Boy Scout
Series are aware&mdash;the leader of the Eagle Patrol,
an organization of patriotic, clean-lived lads,
attracted by the high ideals of the Boy Scout
movement.</p>
<p>The patrol, while of comparatively recent organization,
had been through some stirring adventures.
In <i>The Boy Scouts of The Eagle Patrol</i>,
for instance, we read how Rob and his followers
defeated the machinations of certain jealous and
unworthy enemies. They repaid evil with good,
as is the scout way, but several despicable tricks,
and worse, were played on them. In this book
was related how Joe Digby in the camp of
the Eagles, was kidnaped and imprisoned on a
barren island, and how smoke signaling and
quick wit saved his life. The boys solved a mystery
and had several exciting trials of skill, including
an aeroplane contest, which was almost
spoiled by the trickery of their enemy, Jack
Curtiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>In the second volume, <i>The Boy Scouts on the
Range</i>, we followed our young friends to the Far
West. Here they distinguished themselves, and
formed a mounted patrol, known as <i>The Ranger
Patrol</i>. The pony riders had some exciting incidents
befall them. These included capture by
hostile Indians and a queer adventure in the
haunted caves, in which Tubby almost lost his
life.</p>
<p>In this volume, Jack Curtiss and his gang were
again encountered, but although their trickery
prevailed for a time, in the end they were routed.
A noteworthy feature of this book was the story
of the career and end of Silver Tip, a giant
grizzly bear of sinister reputation in that part of
the country.</p>
<p><i>The Boy Scouts and the Army Airship</i>,
brought the lads into a new and vital field of endeavor.
They met an army officer, who was
conducting secret tests of an aeroplane, and were
enabled to aid him in many ways. In all the
thrilling situations with which this book abounds,
the boys are found always living up to the scout
motto of &ldquo;Be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>How they checkmated the efforts of Stonington
Hunt, an unscrupulous financier, to rob a poor
boy of the fruits of his inventive genius&mdash;a work
in which he was aided by his unworthy son, Freeman
Hunt&mdash;must be read to be appreciated. In
doing this work, however, they earned Hunt&rsquo;s
undying hatred, and, although they thought they
were through with him when he slunk disgraced
out of Hampton, they had not seen the last of
him.</p>
<p>As the present story progresses, we shall learn
how Stonington Hunt and his son tried to avenge
themselves for their fancied wrongs at the hands
of the Boy Scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">TWO MYSTERIOUS MEN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us all about it, Rob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Eagles and the Hawks pressed close about
Rob, as, after the two machines had driven off,
the scouts stood surrounded by curious townsfolk
on the wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much to tell,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, with a laugh.
&ldquo;Major Dangerfield is, it appears, an old friend
of my father. He comes from Essex County, or
rather, he has a summer place up there. On an
automobile trip from Albany, to take his daughter
to visit some friends down on Peconic Bay,
he decided to stop over at Hampton and see the
governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He entered the bank to give dad a surprise,
leaving his daughter outside for a few minutes,
in the machine. She became interested in its
mechanism and pulled a lever, and&mdash;the machine
darted off. And&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he concluded
modestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Except that the leader of the Eagles covered
himself with laurels,&rdquo; struck in Bob&mdash;or Tubby&mdash;Hopkins,
another member of the Eagles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than being covered with fat,&rdquo; parried
Rob, who didn&rsquo;t relish this open praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Rob Blake!&rdquo; yelled Fylan
Fobbs, a town character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hip! hip! hooray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cheers rang out with vim, the voices of
the young scouts sounding shrill and clear among
them, giving the patrol call:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kree-ee-ee-e!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob, coloring and looking embarrassed, made
his way off while the enthusiasm was at its
height. With him went Merritt Crawford,
Tubby Hopkins and tall, lanky Hiram Nelson,
the New England lad, who had already gained
quite a reputation as a wireless operator and mechanical
genius of the all-round variety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon that was a right smart piece of work,&rdquo;
drawled Hiram in his nasal accents, as the four
of them trudged along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-ice, where art thou?&rdquo; hummed Tubby teasingly,
with a sharp glance at Rob. &ldquo;Say, what
a romance for the newspapers: Gallant Boy Scout
rescues bee-yoot-i-ful girl at risk of his life,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further. The tormented Rob
grabbed the rotund youth and twisted his arm
till Tubby yelled for mercy. With a good-natured
laugh, Rob released him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet-ter sue him for damages, if he&rsquo;s broke
your arm,&rdquo; grinned the practical-minded Hiram,
in consolatory tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks; I&rsquo;ve got damages enough, as the
fellow said who&rsquo;d been busted up in a railroad
accident and was asked if he intended to sue,&rdquo;
laughingly rejoined Tubby; &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;and he
dodged to a safe distance&mdash;&ldquo;that was a mighty
pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>As he spoke, they were passing by the railroad
station. A train had just pulled out of it, depositing
two passengers on the platform. But none
of the boys noticed them at the moment. Instead,
their attention was attracted by the strange action
of Merritt, who suddenly darted to the center
of the roadway.</p>
<p>The next instant his action was explained, as
he bent and seized a big leather wallet that lay
there. Or, rather, he was just about to seize it,
when one of the two men who had alighted from
the train also dashed from the small depot, in
front of which they had been standing.</p>
<p>He was a broad-shouldered, rough-looking fellow,
with a coarse beard and hulking shoulders.
His clothes were rather poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you got there, boy?&rdquo; he demanded, as
the other Boy Scouts and his own companion came
up.</p>
<div class="img" id="p001">
<img src="images/p001.jpg" alt="&ldquo;WHAT YOU GOT THERE, BOY?&rdquo; HE DEMANDED." width="500" height="819" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;WHAT YOU GOT THERE, BOY?&rdquo; HE DEMANDED.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;A wallet,&rdquo; said Merritt, examining his find;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s marked &lsquo;R. D.&mdash;U. S. A.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>A strange light came into the rough-looking
man&rsquo;s eyes. His comrade, too, appeared agitated,
and gripped the bearded fellow&rsquo;s arm, whispering
something to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at that wallet, young chap,&rdquo;
quoth the bigger of the two strangers, almost
simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I will,&rdquo; rejoined Merritt;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s lost property, and may contain valuables.
I had better turn it over to the proper authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the rough stranger, without ceremony,
made a snatch for it. Merritt, however, was too
quick for him, and the fellow missed his grasp.
He growled something, and then, apparently
thinking the better of his ill-temper, said in a
comparatively mild voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s my wallet, boy. I must have
dropped it coming across the street. My name&rsquo;s
Roger Dangerfield, Major Roger Dangerfield, of
the United States Army, retired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there must be two of them,&rdquo; exclaimed
Rob sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? What are you interfering for?&rdquo;
growled the rough-looking man, while his companion&mdash;a
much younger individual than himself,
though quite as ill-favored&mdash;edged menacingly
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Rob quietly, &ldquo;I had the pleasure
of talking to Major Dangerfield a few minutes
ago. Moreover, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my
mind that the wallet is his. He probably dropped
it on the way up the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bigger and elder of the two strangers
looked nonplussed for an instant, but he speedily
recovered himself. Making a snatch for the wallet,
which Merritt for an instant had allowed to
show from behind his back, he upset the lad by
the sheer weight of his attack. Flat on his back
fell Merritt, the bearded man toppling over on
top of him.</p>
<p>But, as they fell, the Boy Scout&rsquo;s assailant
seized the wallet from him and tossed it hastily
to his companion, as one might pass a football.
This action was unnoticed by the Boy Scouts,
and the younger man of the two strangers darted
off instantly, with the pocketbook in his possession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>In the meantime, Merritt, by a wrestling trick,
had glided from under the bearded fellow, and,
despite his struggles, the man found himself held
in the firm grip of four determined pairs of
young arms. He was remarkably strong, however,
and the situation speedily assumed the likeness
of an uneven contest, when another detachment
of the Eagles, headed by little Andy Bowles,
the bugler of the Patrol, came up the street on
their way from the exciting scene on the wharf.</p>
<p>Aided by these re&euml;nforcements, the man was
compelled, despite his strength, to give in. All
about him surged his excited young captors. At
this moment an individual came hurrying up. He
wore a semi-official sort of dress, adorned with a
tin badge as big and shiny as a new tin pie-plate.
It was Si Ketchum, the village constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoppin&rsquo; watermillions!&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
all this here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>It took only a few words to tell him. Si assumed
his most terrific official look, which consisted
of partially closing his little reddish eyes
and screwing up his mouth till his gray goatee
pointed outward horizontally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef so be as you&rsquo;ve got that thar contraption
uv a wallet, in ther name uv ther law I commands
yer to surrender said property,&rdquo; he ordered ponderously.</p>
<p>The bearded man, still panting from his struggle,
rejoined with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re not going to believe a pack of
irresponsible boys, constable. I know nothing
about the wallet, except that I saw that lad there
pick it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;hah,&rdquo; said Si, wagging his head sagely,
&ldquo;go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, I was anxious to see what it was.
I demanded to have a look at it, thinking it might
be some of my property that I had dropped.
What was my astonishment, when this young ruffian
attacked me. In self-defense, I resisted, and
then they all set on me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That story is a fabrication from start to finish,&rdquo;
cried Merritt, while the others shouted their
angry confirmation of his denial. &ldquo;Let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the second time he was about to relate the
true circumstances. But Si interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one way ter settle this,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way you like, officer,&rdquo; said the bearded
man suavely, &ldquo;anything that you say, I&rsquo;ll agree
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air yer willin&rsquo; ter be searched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. But not here in the public street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then; at the calaboose, ef that&rsquo;ll
suit yer better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will. Let&rsquo;s proceed there,&rdquo; said the man,
with a sidelong look at the boys, who began to
wonder at his assurance.</p>
<p>Followed by a small crowd, Si and his prisoner
led the way to the &ldquo;calaboose,&rdquo; a small, red-brick
structure on a side street not far from the station.
The boys waited eagerly outside, while within
the walls of Si&rsquo;s fortress the search went on.
Before long, the constable emerged with an angry
face, and very red. The stranger, cool and smiling,
was beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What kind uv an April fool joke is this?&rdquo;
demanded Si loudly, while the boys, and the
townspeople, who had been attracted by curiosity,
looked at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys ain&rsquo;t tole me the truth,&rdquo; he went on,
waxing more furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t found the wallet?&rdquo; demanded
Merritt. &ldquo;Why, I distinctly felt him
snatch it from my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, it ain&rsquo;t on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other man!&rdquo; cried Rob, suddenly recalling
the bearded man&rsquo;s companion, and perceiving,
likewise, for the first time since Merritt&rsquo;s adventure,
that the fellow had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; cried half a dozen voices.</p>
<p>In the same instant, they became aware that
the bearded man had also vanished in the excitement.
Almost simultaneously, Major Dangerfield
put in an unexpected appearance. He was
out of breath, as if from running.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the police station?&rdquo; he demanded of
Si, and, receiving a nod from that stupefied official,
he hastened on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to report the loss of a pocketbook. I
must have dropped it on Main Street. Has it
been found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wuz found all right,&rdquo; grunted Si, &ldquo;but&mdash;it&rsquo;s
bin lost agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Crawford here, found it, sir,&rdquo;
struck in Rob, seeing the major&rsquo;s evident agitation
at Si&rsquo;s not over-lucid explanation, &ldquo;but
while he still had it in his hand, a man&mdash;a rough-looking
customer&mdash;demanded to see it. As soon
as Merritt told him of the initials on it, he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried to seize it,&rdquo; exclaimed the major excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, wondering inwardly
how the major guessed so accurately what had occurred,
&ldquo;there was a scuffle, and in it the man
who had attacked Merritt must, in some way,
have found a chance to pass the pocketbook to
his companion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was the man who first inquired about the
book a big, bearded man, with sun-burned face
and rather shabby clothes?&rdquo; inquired the major.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s astonishment increased. Evidently this
was no ordinary case of ruffianism. It would
seem now that the men were known to the major,
and had some strong object in taking the book.</p>
<p>The boy nodded in reply to the major&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind stepping aside with me a few
minutes, my lad? I&rsquo;d like to ask you some questions,&rdquo;
continued the retired officer.</p>
<p>He and Rob conversed privately for some moments.
Then the major strode off, after authorizing
Si to offer a reward of five hundred dollars
for the return of the wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me to thank all you fellows for the
aid you gave in trying to hold the man,&rdquo; said
Rob when he rejoined his comrades, &ldquo;he added
that it would not be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Nor was it, for it may be said here, that a few
days later a fine launch, named <i>Eagle</i>, was delivered
at Hampton harbor with a card from the
major, begging the Eagle Patrol to accept it as
their official craft. But we are anticipating a
little.</p>
<p>As Rob walked away with Merritt, Tubby and
Hiram, the lanky youth spoke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beats creation what there could have been
in that wallet to upset him so,&rdquo; he commented;
&ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t look like a man who&rsquo;s easily excited,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it was,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, &ldquo;we
are likely to learn this evening. I rather think
the major has some work on hand for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray! some action at last,&rdquo; cried Merritt
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t had enough to-day, eh?&rdquo; inquired
Tubby sarcastically. &ldquo;I should think that seeing
a runaway auto stopped, being knocked down and
plunged into a mystery, would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind him, Merritt; the heat&rsquo;s sent the
fat to his head,&rdquo; laughed Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that Major
Dangerfield has invited us to the house this
evening to hear something interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All four of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I rather think then we shall learn some
more about that wallet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after, the boys, following some talk concerning
patrol matters, separated. Each went
to his home to await, with what patience he might,
the coming of evening, when it appeared
likely that some light would be shed on what, to
them, seemed an interesting puzzle. Rob, on his
return home, found that the major had motored
on to his friend&rsquo;s with his daughter, but he had
promised to return in time to keep his appointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">THE MAJOR EXPLAINS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began the major, &ldquo;I suppose you are
all naturally curious concerning that wallet of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four lads nodded attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must admit we are,&rdquo; volunteered Rob.</p>
<p>They were gathered in the library of Mr.
Blake&rsquo;s home. The banker was seated in his
own pet chair, while the major stood with his
back to a bookcase, a group of eager-eyed Boy
Scouts surrounding him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; continued the major, &ldquo;I
think you would better all sit down. The story
is a somewhat lengthy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys obeyed, and the major began:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to take you back more than a
century,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the days when the first settlers
located adjacent to the south banks of Lake
Champlain. Among the colonists were my ancestors,
Chisholm Dangerfield and his family.
Chisholm Dangerfield was the eldest son of the
Dangerfield family, of Chester, England. He
had been left an ample fortune, but having
squandered it, decided, like many others in a similar
case, to emigrate to the new country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On arrival here, he and his family went up
the river to Albany, and there, hearing of new
settlements along the lake, decided to take up
land there. They went most of the way by water,
being much harassed by Indians on the journey.
But without any serious mishaps, they finally arrived
at their destination, and, in course of time,
established a flourishing farm. But Chisholm
Dangerfield had a younger brother, a harum-scarum
sort of youth, to whom, nevertheless, he
was much attached. When quite young, this lad
had run away to sea, and little had been heard
of him since that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But while his family had remained in ignorance
of his whereabouts, he had joined a band of
West Indian pirates, and in course of time
amassed a considerable fortune. Then a desire
to reform came over him, and he sought his English
relatives. They would have nothing to do
with him, despite his wealth, and in a fit of rage
he left England to seek his brother&mdash;the only being
who ever really cared for him. In due time
he arrived at the farm with quite a retinue of
friendly Indians and carriers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was warmly welcomed. Possibly his
money and wealth had something to do with it.
I don&rsquo;t know anything about that, however. At
any rate, for some years, he lived there, till one
day he fell ill. His constitution was undermined
by the reckless, wild life he had led, and he died
not long after. He left all his gold and jewels
to his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians were many and hostile in those days,
so in order to be secure in case of an attack, the
elder brother had no sooner buried his kin with
due reverence, and received his legacy, than he
decided to secrete the entire amount of the old
pirate&rsquo;s treasure in a cave in a remote part of
the Adirondacks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby, who was hugging
his knees, while his eyes showed round as saucers
in his fat cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Indians get it?&rdquo; asked Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, and you shall hear,&rdquo; continued
the major. &ldquo;Well, as I said, the treasure was
buried in a cave so securely hidden that nobody
would be able to find it again, except by a miracle,
or by aid of the chart of the spot, which Chisholm
Dangerfield carefully made. A few nights after
that, a tribe went on the warpath, landed in
canoes near to the Dangerfield farm, and massacred
every soul on the place but one&mdash;a young
boy named Roger Dangerfield, who escaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This Roger Dangerfield was my great-great-grandfather.
With him, when he fled from the
burning ruins, he took a paper his father had
thrust into his hands just before the Indian attack
came. All this he wrote in his diary, which
did not come into my hands till recently. Well,
Roger Dangerfield, left to his own resources,
proved so able a youth that he was, before very
long, a prosperous merchant in Albany. But in
the meantime he made several expeditions to the
mountains to try to find the hidden wealth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have told you that the paper was in
cipher, and a very elaborate one, so that it had
never been completely worked out. This, no
doubt, accounts for Roger Dangerfield&rsquo;s failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in course of time, the cipher became a
family relic along with Roger Dangerfield&rsquo;s diary.
His descendants moved to Virginia, where I was
born. I recollect, as a youngster, being enthralled
by the story of the old piratical Dangerfield&rsquo;s
hidden gold, and resolving that when I grew up I
would find it. We had, in our employ at that
time, a butler named Jarley. I was an only child,
and he was my confidant. I naturally told him
about the cipher and what its unraveling would
mean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This happened when I was about eighteen
and home on a vacation. Jarley seemed much
interested, but after both he and I had puzzled
in vain over the cipher, we gave it up. When I
came home on my next vacation, I learned that
Jarley had left. His mother and father had died,
he declared, and he was required at his home in
Maine. Well, I thought no more of the matter,
and forming new acquaintances in our neighborhood,
which was rapidly settling, I soon forgot
Jarley. But one day a notion seized me to look
at the cipher and the diary again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when I came to look for them, they had
gone. Nor did any search result in my finding
them. It at once flashed across my mind that
Jarley might have taken them. So fixed an idea
did this become, that I visited the place in Maine
to which he said he had gone, only to find that
he had removed soon after his return from Virginia.
However, pursuing the trail, I found
that he&mdash;or a man resembling him&mdash;had visited
the spot on the lake where the old-time house
had stood, and had made a mysterious expedition
into the mountains. The spot was at that time
known as Dangerfield, and was quite a flourishing
little town, with a pulp mill and a few other
local industries. In that quiet community they
recollected the mysterious visitor well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;However, as I learned, Jarley had left the
town without paying his guides or the man from
whom he had hired the horses, I concluded that
the expedition had not been successful. Then I
advertised for the man, but without success.
Then I was appointed to West Point, and for a
long time I thought no more of the matter. In
fact, for years it lay dormant in my mind, with
occasional flashes of memory; then I would advertise
for Jarley or his heirs, but without success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The last time I advertised was about a year
ago. After six months&rsquo; silence I received a letter,
asking me to call at an address near the Erie
Basin in Brooklyn, if I was interested in the
long-lost Jarley. All my enthusiasm once more
at fever heat, I set out for the place. The address
at which I was to call I found to be a
squalid sailors&rsquo; boarding-house. On inquiring
there for James Jarley, the name signed to the
letter, I was conducted into a dirty room, where
lay a rough-looking sailor, evidently just recovering
from the effects of a debauch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So dulled was his mind, that it was some time
before I could explain my errand, but finally he
understood. He frankly told me he was out for
money, and wanted to know how much I would
give him for some papers he had which his father&mdash;our
old butler, it transpired&mdash;had left him. His
father, he said, had told him that if ever he
wanted to make money with them he was to seek
out a Major Dangerfield, who would be likely
to pay him well for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it appeared that his father had also told
him that he stood a chance of arrest if he did so,
and that it might be a dangerous step. However,
he told me that he had at length decided to take
that chance, and on a return from a long voyage,
during which he had encountered my advertisement
in an old newspaper in a foreign port, he
had made up his mind to find me on his return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;His father, it appeared, had always kept track
of me, but fear and shame had kept him from
trying to arrange a meeting. The son, I gathered,
both from his conversation and the situation
in which I found him, had always been a
ne&rsquo;er-do-well. Well, the matter ended with my
paying him a sum of money for the papers, which
as I suspected, proved to be the yellow-paged old
diary and the well-thumbed, tattered cipher. Then
I had him removed to a hospital, where a few
days later he died in an attack of delirium.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE NARRATIVE CONTINUED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But it appeared that even while on his deathbed
the man had been playing a dishonest game.
Before he had made his bargain with me, he had
revealed the secret and tried to sell it to a certain
money-lender at a seaport in Maine. This man
had refused to have anything to do with what he
thought was a chimerical scheme, but later confided
the whole thing to a friend of his by name
Stonington Hunt&mdash;a former Wall Street man,
who had been compelled to quit in disgrace the
scene of his financial operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stonington Hunt!&rdquo; gasped Rob, leaning forward
in his chair, while the others looked equally
amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the name. Why, do you know
him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Know him, Major!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Blake. &ldquo;He
was concerned in some rascally operations in this
village not so long ago. That he left here under
a cloud, was mainly due to activities of the Boy
Scouts, whose enemy he was. We heard he had
gone to Maine. Is he engaged in new rascality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall hear,&rdquo; pursued the major. &ldquo;Well,
as I said, this seaport money-lender told Stonington
Hunt of the chart and cipher and the old
diary recording the burial of the treasure. Hunt,
it would seem, placed more importance on the
information than had the money-lender, for he
agreed, provided the latter would help to finance
an expedition, to try to solve the cipher, or else
have some expert translate it. He set out at
once for Brooklyn, arriving there, as I subsequently
learned, just after I had departed with
the diary and the papers which young Jarley had
carried in his sea-chest for some years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He lost no time in tracing me, and offered me
a large sum for the papers. But my interest had
been aroused. For the sake of the adventure of
the thing, and also to clear up the mystery, I
had resolved to go treasure hunting myself. With
this object in view, I rented a bungalow on a
lake not far from the range in which I suspected
the treasure cave lay, and devoted days and nights
trying to solve the cipher. At this time a college
professor, an old chum of mine, wrote me that
his health was broken down, and that he needed a
rest. I invited him to come and visit me in
Essex County, at the same time suggesting that I
had a hard nut for him to crack. Professor Jeremiah
Jorum arrived soon after, and his health
picked up amazingly in the mountain air. One
day he asked about &lsquo;the hard nut.&rsquo; I produced the
cipher, and told him something of its history.
Perhaps I should have told you that Professor
Jorum has devoted a good deal of his life to
what is known as cryptology&mdash;or the solving of
seemingly unsolvable puzzles. He had translated
Egyptian cryptograms and inscriptions left by
vanished tribes on ruins in Yucatan and Old
Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He worked for several days on the cipher,
and one day came to me with a radiant face. He
told me he had solved it. No wonder I had failed.
It was a simple enough cipher&mdash;one of the least
complex, in fact&mdash;but the language used had been
Latin, in which my ancestor, as a well-bred Englishman
of that day, was proficient. As he was
telling me this, I noticed a man I had hired some
days before, hanging about the open windows. I
ordered him away, and he went at once. But I
had grave suspicions that he had overheard a
good deal more than I should have wished him to.
However, there was no help for it. I dismissed
the matter from my mind, and we&mdash;the professor
and I&mdash;spent the rest of the day discussing the
cipher and the best means for recovering the
treasure. We agreed it would be dangerous to
take men we could not absolutely trust, and yet,
we should require several people to organize a
proper expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, as it so happened, all our plans had to be
changed that night. I was awakened soon after
midnight by a noise in my room. In the dim
light I saw a figure that I recognized as our
gardener, moving about. The lamp beside my
bed had, for some reason, not gone out when I
turned it down on retiring, and I soon had the
room in a blaze of light. The intruder sprang
toward me, a big club in his hand. I dodged the
blow and grappled with him. In the struggle
his beard fell off, and I recognized, to my amazement,
that our &lsquo;gardener&rsquo; was Stonington Hunt
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shock of this surprise had hardly been
borne in upon me when the fellow, who possessed
considerable strength, forced me back against the
table. In the scuffle the lamp was upset. In a
flash the place was in a blaze. Hunt was out of
the room in two bounds. He seized the key, as
he went, and locked the door on the outside, thus
leaving me to burn to death, or chance injury
by a leap from the window, which overhung a
cliff above the lake. I had just time to throw on
a few clothes and grab the papers, which I had
luckily placed under my pillow, before the flames
drove me out. The wood of the door was flimsy,
and without bothering to try to force the lock, I
smashed out a panel. Crawling through, I
aroused my friend Jorum and my old negro servant,
Jumbo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We saved nothing but the precious papers,
but as the bungalow was roughly furnished, I did
not much care. We made our way to a distant
house and stayed there the night. The next day
we took a wagon to the shore of the lake and
went by boat to Whitehall. There we embarked
on a train for Albany, where my daughter was
at the home of friends. I, too, have a residence
there, but, having received an invitation from
friends to visit them on Long Island, I decided
to give my little girl a motor trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while in Albany I perceived I was
being followed, and by the two men whom you
have described to me as taking part in the filching
of the wallet. I thought I had thrown them
off, however, but your adventure to-day proves
that I have not been as successful as I hoped.
The most unfortunate part of it is that the cipher
was in that wallet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; groaned Tubby dolorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that. I am hopeful that we
may recover it,&rdquo; said the retired officer. &ldquo;I have
wired my friend Jorum, who, with Jumbo, is now
in New York, and I am in hopes that he can recollect
something of his translation of the cipher.
If not&mdash;well, there&rsquo;s no use crossing bridges till
we come to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do recover it?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, I am going to ask your parents to let
me borrow a patrol of Boy Scouts to aid in the
treasure hunt,&rdquo; smiled the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Major,&rdquo; cried Mr. Blake, holding up
his hands, &ldquo;Mrs. Blake would never consent
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there would be such a lot of fun, dad,&rdquo;
urged Rob. &ldquo;Think of a camp in the mountains.
We&rsquo;d have to camp, wouldn&rsquo;t we, Major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. It would be a fine opportunity for
you to perfect yourselves in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Woodcraft,&rdquo; said Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signaling,&rdquo; put in Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a field wireless apparatus I&rsquo;d like to
try out,&rdquo; put in Hiram, his voice a-quiver with
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the first thing to be done is to recover
that cipher,&rdquo; said the major; &ldquo;at present all we
know of it is that it is in the hands of two rascals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the employ of another rascal, Stonington
Hunt,&rdquo; put in Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can do nothing more to-night,&rdquo; said
the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We were so interested in your story that
I think none of us noticed how the time flew by,&rdquo;
said Mr. Blake, and Mrs. Blake, entering just
then, announced that there was supper ready for
the party in the dining-room. Tubby&rsquo;s eyes glittered
at this news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Soon after the sandwiches, cakes and lemonade
had been disposed of, the Boy Scouts set out for
home, agreeing to meet the major next morning
after breakfast.</p>
<p>They had not gone many steps from the house
when Tubby stopped as suddenly as if he had
been shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gingersnaps!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
thought of something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! Must hurt,&rdquo; jeered Merritt unsympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that is, yes&mdash;no, I mean,&rdquo; sputtered the
fat boy. &ldquo;Say, fellows, I heard this afternoon
that Sam Phelps from Aquebogue told a fellow
in the village that he had seen Freeman Hunt
over there this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You double-dyed chump,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob,
who was walking a way with them, &ldquo;and you
never said anything about it. If Freeman was
there, I&rsquo;ll bet his father was, too, and that&rsquo;s
where those two men have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz, if they have they must be there
yet, then!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt, excitedly, &ldquo;unless
they left by automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way. There was no train after those
chaps took the wallet, till almost eight o&rsquo;clock.
They must have hidden in the woods and
caught it some place below, unless Si arrested
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have been at the house to get the reward
if he had,&rdquo; rejoined Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. He didn&rsquo;t catch them, and
if the Hunts are at Aquebogue, that&rsquo;s where
they&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what&rsquo;s to prevent them leaving
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No train after nine-thirty till to-morrow
morning, and the eight o&rsquo;clock from here doesn&rsquo;t
get to Aquebogue till after that time; so they
must be stranded there, unless they have a car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cookies and cream cakes! That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;
cried Tubby, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s phone the police at Aquebogue
to look out for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>But the lads found that the wire between
Hampton and Aquebogue wasn&rsquo;t working. The
telegraph office was closed. They exchanged
blank glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; demanded Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What all good scouts ought to do&mdash;the best
we can,&rdquo;&mdash;rejoined Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is, under the present circumstances?&rdquo;
questioned Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go to our garage&mdash;Blenkinsop&rsquo;s&mdash;on Main
Street, and get out the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be closed,&rdquo; rejoined Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a key,&rdquo; replied Rob; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;phone the
house that I&rsquo;m going for a night spin. We can
get there, notify the police, and be back in two
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, scouts!&rdquo; ordered Merritt, in sharp,
&ldquo;parade-ground&rdquo; tones, &ldquo;and &lsquo;Be Prepared&rsquo; for
whatever comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Rob found that the telephone to his home was
also out of order, owing to repairs which were
being rushed through by night. So ten minutes
later, when the car glided out of the garage on
Main Street and slipped silently through the
sleeping town, there was nobody in Hampton who
knew the Boy Scouts&rsquo; night mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A MIDNIGHT AUTO DASH.</span></h2>
<p>The auto, a fast and heavy machine, plunged
along through the night at a great rate. Its
bright searchlight cast a brilliant circle of radiance
far ahead into the darkness. Occasionally
frightened birds could be seen flying out of the
inky hedges, falling bewildered in the path of
the white glare.</p>
<p>It was exhilarating, blood-stirring work, all
the more keenly delightful from the sense of
adventure with which it was spiced.</p>
<p>Rob was at the wheel, steering straight and
steady. He knew the road well. Part of it had
been the scene of that thrilling night ride described
in <i>The Boy Scouts and the Army Airship</i>,
when the boys had overtaken the two
thieves who had stolen the aeroplane documents.
On that occasion, it will be recalled, an accident
had been narrowly averted by a soul-stirring
hair&rsquo;s breadth, as a train dashed across the
tracks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s three companions sat back in the tonneau
and conversed in low tones. Only the irrepressible
Tubby was not duly impressed with the
momentousness of the occasion. From time to
time a snicker of laughter showed that he was
cracking jokes in the same old way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he remarked, as they bumped across the
railroad tracks, &ldquo;even if we do find out where
these fellows are, I don&rsquo;t know just what we&rsquo;re
going to do with them at this time of night. Reminds
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for goodness&rsquo; sake, Tubby,&rdquo; groaned
Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go ahead,&rdquo; struck in Hiram, &ldquo;the
sooner he blows off all his steam the sooner he&rsquo;ll
shut up for good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me,&rdquo; went on the unruffled Tubby,
&ldquo;of what a little girl said to her mother when
the kid asked her what sardines were. The
mother explained that they were small fish that
big ones ate. Then the little girl wanted to know
how the big fish got them out of the tins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a deathly silence, broken only by
a low groan from Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call that a joke?&rdquo; he moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spring any more. My life ain&rsquo;t insured,
by heck,&rdquo; put in Yankee Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that got a laugh in the minstrel show
where I heard it,&rdquo; responded the aggrieved joke-smith.</p>
<p>Before long, lights flashed ahead of them, and,
descending a steepish hill, they chugged into the
town of Aquebogue. It was a fairly large town,
and here and there lighted windows showed that
some of the low resorts were still open for business.
Far down the street shone two green
lights, which marked the police station. The auto
glided up to this, and Rob jumped out, accompanied
by Merritt, leaving Tubby and Hiram in
the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out and stretch our legs a bit,&rdquo; said
Tubby presently. It was taking some time for
Rob to explain his errand to a sleepy police official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my boy,&rdquo; drawled Hiram. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not averse to a bit of leg-stretching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two lads got out and strolled as far as
the street corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;s&rsquo;h!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby suddenly, as they
reached it. He seized Hiram&rsquo;s arm with every
appearance of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-al, what is it now?&rdquo; asked the down-east
boy; &ldquo;more jokes and didoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. See that chap just sneaking down the
street from the opposite corner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what of it? Are you seeing things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But it&rsquo;s Freeman Hunt&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By ginger, I believe you are right! It does
look like him, for a fact. But what can he be
doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no more idea than you. But he must be
up to some mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that where Freeman Hunt is, his
father is not far off, and the rest of the gang
must be about here, too. I guess it was a good
thing we came out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what shall we do? Go back and tell
the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. While we were gone he&rsquo;d sneak away,
and we might miss him altogether. I&rsquo;ve got a
better plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow him at a distance and see where
he goes. Then we can come back and report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sa-ay, that&rsquo;s a good idea. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman Hunt was almost out of sight now.
But as the two scouts took up the trail, they saw
him pause where a flood of light streamed from
the window of a drinking-place. He paused here
for an instant and gave a low whistle; presently
the boys&rsquo; hearts gave a bound. From the doors
of the resort issued three figures, one of which
they recognized, even at that distance, as Stonington
Hunt. With him were the two men who
had played such a prominent part in the filching
of the wallet belonging to Major Dangerfield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep in the shadow,&rdquo; whispered Tubby,
crouching in a convenient doorway; &ldquo;they
haven&rsquo;t seen us. Hullo, there they go. Keep a
good distance behind&mdash;as far back as we can,
without losing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men the scouts were trailing struck into
a lively pace. They seemed to be conversing
earnestly. Through the shadows the two boys
crept along behind them. Presently they were
traversing a residence street, edged with elms
and lawns and white picket fences. It was deserted
and silent. The occupants of the houses
were wrapped in sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re going to turn into one of these
houses,&rdquo; whispered Hiram.</p>
<p>But the men didn&rsquo;t. Instead, they kept right
on, and before long the last electric light had been
passed and they were in the open country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better turn back?&rdquo; murmured
Hiram. &ldquo;It looks as if we were going too far
for safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep on,&rdquo; urged Tubby. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
danger. If we gave up the chase now we&rsquo;d have
had all our work for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram made no reply, and the two boys, taking
advantage of every bit of cover&mdash;as the game
of &ldquo;Hare and Hounds&rdquo; had taught them&mdash;kept
right on dogging the footsteps of their quarry.
All at once Tubby began sniffing the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting near the sea,&rdquo; he proclaimed.
&ldquo;I can smell the salt meadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aquebogue lay some distance back from the
open waters of the ocean. It was situated, like
Hampton itself, on an inlet. In the dim light
of the stars, the two boys presently perceived
that they were traversing a sort of dyke or raised
road leading across the marshes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can they be going?&rdquo; wondered Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. But there are lots of fishermen&rsquo;s
huts and shacks dotted about in the marshes.
Maybe they are making for one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; opined Hiram, &ldquo;but if you weren&rsquo;t
so all-sot on following them, I&rsquo;d be in a good
mind to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; persisted Tubby, and the chase continued.</p>
<p>But it was soon to end. All at once the faint
glimmer of a watercourse, or inlet from the sea,
shone dimly in front of them. Upreared, too,
against the star-spangled sky, they could see the
inky outlines of a structure of some kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crouch down here,&rdquo; said Tubby suddenly, as
the men ahead of them came to a halt.</p>
<p>A bunch of marsh grass offered a convenient
hiding place, and behind it the two boys lay flat.
Pretty soon they heard the scratch of a match,
and then the grating of a lock, as the door of the
dark building they had remarked was opened.
The men entered the place and slammed the door
to. A few instants later, from the solitary window
of the shack, a light shone out. The window
was toward the creek, and the glare from it
showed the two watching boys the mast and rigging
of a large sloop. At least, from her spars,
they judged her to be of considerable size.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve found
the place, all right. They must have come in that
sloop. Maybe that&rsquo;s the way the two men who
took the wallet got out of Hampton unobserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the wind&rsquo;s against the sloop, and she
couldn&rsquo;t have beaten her way down here in that
time,&rdquo; objected Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have an engine, mightn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
whispered Tubby in scornful tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Lots of boats do have gasoline
motors. I guess you&rsquo;re right, Tubby. What are
you going to do now? Go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; rejoined the fat boy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just
have a look into that hut and see what&rsquo;s going
on. We might even get a chance to get that wallet
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re not going to take such a chance!
If you looked through that window&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did I say I was going to look through the
window, stupid? Don&rsquo;t you see that chimney on
the roof? Now, the roof comes down low, almost
to the ground. I&rsquo;m going to climb up on it, and,
by leaning over the chimney, I can hear what is
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll hear your feet on the roof,&rdquo; objected
the practical Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take my shoes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully risky, Tubby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, look here, Hiram,&rdquo; sputtered the fat boy,
&ldquo;if this country was to go to war, you&rsquo;d want to
go to the front and fight for Old Glory as a Boy
Scout, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, don&rsquo;t you suppose that if you were
scouting after an enemy you&rsquo;d have to take bigger
chances than this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram said no more. Kicking their shoes off,
and leaving them by the grass hummock, the
two boys crept forward as silently as two cats.
In the yielding sand their feet made no noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>As Tubby had surmised, at the rear of the
house the roof came almost to the ground, for the
sand was heaped up against that particular wall,
being driven in big dunes by the winds off the
ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with you,&rdquo; whispered Tubby, giving Hiram
a &ldquo;boost.&rdquo; The Yankee boy&rsquo;s long legs carried
him onto the roof in a jiffy. Then came
Tubby. Already the two boys could hear below
them the low hum of voices, Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s
sharp, boyish tones mingling with the bass drone
of the elder men&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>The roof was formed of driftwood and old timbers,
and was as easy to climb as a staircase.
Before many seconds, the boys were at the chimney.
With beating pulses and a heart that
throbbed faster than was altogether comfortable,
in spite of his easy-going disposition, Tubby
raised himself and peered down the flue. It was
of brick. But to his astonishment, as he peered
over the edge, he found he had a clear view of
the room below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The chimney, as is often the case in rough
dwellings, did not go all the way down to the
floor. Instead, it was supported on two beams,
so that, peering down it, the boy could command
a view of the room below, just as if he had been
looking down a telescope.</p>
<p>Round a table were seated Stonington Hunt,
the two rough-looking men who had stolen the
wallet, and Freeman Hunt. A smoky glass lamp
stood on the rough box which served for a table.
Spread out on the table, too, was something that
almost made Tubby let go his hold of the chimney
and go sliding down the roof. It was the wallet,
and beside it lay the paper covered with figures
and markings, which, the boy had no doubt,
was the precious document of the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get out of here early in the
morning,&rdquo; Stonington Hunt was saying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
fancy having the police on my heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And Jim here says that those pesky Boy
Scouts are mixed up in the search for the wallet,&rdquo;
struck in Freeman Hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is the time we give those brats
the slip,&rdquo; growled his father. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s
turn in. We&rsquo;ll get the motor going and drop
down the creek before daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better leave the light burning then,&rdquo; said
one of the men who had been in Hampton that
afternoon.</p>
<p>This was done, and presently snores and heavy
breathing showed the men were asleep. Tubby
could not see what resting places they had found,
but assumed that there must be bunks around the
edge of the hut, as is usual in such fishermen&rsquo;s
shelters.</p>
<p>Before retiring, the men had shoved the paper
into the wallet, but for some reason, probably
they didn&rsquo;t think of it during their preparations
for sleep, the wallet had been left on the table.
It was almost directly below the chimney. As
Tubby looked at it, he had a sudden idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a bit of wire, Hiram?&rdquo; he asked, knowing
that the mechanical genius of the Eagle Patrol
usually carried such odds and ends with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve got a bit of brass wire right here,&rdquo;
rejoined Hiram, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t very long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Long enough,&rdquo; commented Tubby, scrutinizing
the bit handed to him, &ldquo;now, if you had some
string&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a bit of fish line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better. Give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much mystified, Hiram watched the fat boy
bend the bit of wire and tie it to the string.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going fishing?&rdquo; he asked in a sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Tubby quite seriously.</p>
<p>His quick eye had noted that the straps that
closed the wallet had not been placed round it
but lay in a loose loop on the table. If only he
could entangle his improvised line in the loop, it
would be an easy matter to fish up the wallet.
If only he could do it!</p>
<p>Very cautiously, for he knew the risk he was
running, Tubby lowered his line. Then he
waited. But the breathing below continued
steady and stentorian. Swinging his hook, which
was quite heavy, the stout boy grappled cautiously
for the wallet. It was tantalizing and
delicate work. But after taking an infinity of
pains, he finally succeeded in getting it fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Tubby at this moment had difficulty in suppressing
a shout of &ldquo;hooray!&rdquo; But he mastered
his emotions, and slowly and delicately began to
haul in his &ldquo;catch.&rdquo; Hiram, fascinated, crept
close to his side. Perhaps it was this fact that
was responsible for the disaster that occurred the
next instant.</p>
<p>Without the slightest warning, save a sharp,
cracking sound, the roof caved in under their
feet. In a flash, both boys were projected in a
heap into the room below. As they hurtled
through the rotten covering of the hut, shouts
and cries resounded from the aroused occupants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">IN DIREST PERIL.</span></h2>
<p>The wildest confusion ensued. Fortunately,
the drop was a short one, and beyond a few
scratches and bruises, neither boy was hurt. The
lamp, by some strange fatality, was not put out,
but rolled off the table. As Stonington Hunt
sprang at him, Tubby seized it. He brandished
it threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Boy Scouts!&rdquo; shouted Stonington Hunt,
the first to recover from his stupefaction at the
sudden interruption to their slumbers.</p>
<p>He dashed at Tubby, who swung the lamp for
an instant&mdash;it was his only weapon&mdash;and then
dashed it, like a smoky meteor, full at the advancing
man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>It missed him by the fraction of an inch, or he
would have been turned into a living torch.</p>
<p>Crash!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>The lamp struck the opposite wall, and was
shattered into a thousand fragments. Instantly
the place was plunged in darkness, total and absolute.
At the same instant a sharp report
sounded. It seemed doubly loud in the tiny place.
The fumes of the powder filled it reekingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; roared Stonington Hunt.
&ldquo;Guard the door and window. Don&rsquo;t let them
get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dad,&rdquo; the boys heard Freeman
Hunt cry loudly, as he scuffled across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the doorway and the window,&rdquo; shouted
Stonington Hunt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a light in a jiffy.
We&rsquo;ve got them like two rats in a cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he struck a match and lit a boat lantern that
stood on a shelf, a low groan came from one corner
of the room. Hiram was horrified to
perceive that it was Tubby who uttered it. The
shot must have wounded him, fired at haphazard,
as it had been. The man who had aimed it, the
bearded member of the gang, stood grimly by the
doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Almost beside himself at the hopelessness of
their situation, Hiram gazed about him. All at
once he noticed that on Tubby&rsquo;s chest a crimson
stain was slowly spreading. The stout boy lay
quite still except for an occasional quiver and
groan. Without a thought as to his danger,
Hiram disregarded Stonington Hunt&rsquo;s next injunction:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swiftly he crossed to his wounded comrade.
He sank on his knees beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T-T-T-Tubby,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;are you badly
hurt, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his amazement, the recumbent Tubby gave
him a swift but knowing wink, and then, rolling
over on his side again, resumed his groaning once
more. Mystified, but comforted, Hiram was rising,
when a rough hand seized him and sent him
spinning to an opposite corner. It was the burly
form of the bearded man that had propelled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so rough, Jim Dale,&rdquo; warned Stonington
Hunt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got them where they can&rsquo;t escape.
Lots of time to get what we want out of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pesky young spies,&rdquo; snorted Jim Dale,
&ldquo;I wonder how much they overheard of what we
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter, anyhow,&rdquo; put in his beardless
companion of the afternoon. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t have
no chance to tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s right, Pete Bumpus,&rdquo; struck in
the bearded man. Suddenly Hiram felt a stinging
slap across the face. He turned and faced
young Freeman Hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like that, eh?&rdquo; snarled the youth
viciously. &ldquo;Here is where I pay you out for
what you Scout kids did to me when we lived in
Hampton.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>He was stepping forward to deliver another
blow, when Hiram ducked swiftly, and put into
execution a maneuver Rob had shown him. As
Freeman, a bigger and heavier lad, rushed forward,
Hiram&rsquo;s long leg and his long left arm
shot out simultaneously. The leg engaged Freeman&rsquo;s
ankle, and the Yankee lad&rsquo;s fist encountered
the other&rsquo;s chin with a sharp crack. Freeman
Hunt fell in a heap on the floor. Hiram
braced himself for an attack by the whole four.
But it didn&rsquo;t come. Instead, they seemed to
think it a good joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will teach you to keep your temper,&rdquo;
laughed the boy&rsquo;s father roughly; &ldquo;plenty of time
to punch him and pummel him when we have
them tied up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I won&rsquo;t do it, too,&rdquo; promised Freeman,
gathering himself up, with a crestfallen look.</p>
<p>Stonington Hunt stepped up to Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth, you young brat,&rdquo; he
snarled; &ldquo;are the police after us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram pondered an instant before answering.
Then he decided on a course of action. Possibly
it was a bad one, judging by the immediate
results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are,&rdquo; he said boldly, &ldquo;and if you
don&rsquo;t let us loose, you&rsquo;ll get in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Stonington Hunt paused irresolutely. Then he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the sloop ready, boys. We&rsquo;ll get out of
here on the jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later Hiram&rsquo;s hands were
bound and he was led on board the craft the boys
had noticed lying in the creek. A plank connected
it with the shore. Tubby, still groaning,
was carried on board and thrown down in the
bow beside Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll attend to him after a while,&rdquo; said Hunt
brutally; &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s badly wounded it&rsquo;s his own
fault, for meddling in other folks&rsquo; affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men went below. Presently there
came a sharp chug-chug, and the anchor being
taken in, the sloop began to move off down the
creek. As Tubby Hopkins had surmised, she
had an engine. Hunt, Jim Dale and Peter Bumpus
stood in the bow. Hiram leaned disconsolately
against a stay, and Tubby lay at his feet
on a coil of rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>The shores slipped rapidly by, and pretty soon
the creek began to widen.</p>
<p>Freeman Hunt was at the wheel, and from
time to time Jim Dale shouted directions back
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port&mdash;port! Hard over!&rdquo; or again, &ldquo;Hard
over! Starboard! There&rsquo;s a shoal right ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moon had risen now, and in the silvery light
the darker water of the shoals, of which the
creek seemed full, showed plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This crik&rsquo;s as full of sand-bars as a hound
dorg is uv fleas,&rdquo; grunted Jim Dale. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
be full tide for two hours or more, either.
If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a sudden, grinding jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard over! Hard over!&rdquo; bellowed Jim Dale.</p>
<p>Freeman Hunt spun the wheel like a squirrel
in its cage. But it was too late. The sloop had
grounded hard and fast. Leaving Peter Bumpus
to guard the boys, Jim Dale and the elder Hunt
leaped swiftly aft. They backed the motor, but
it was no use. The sloop was too hard aground
to be gotten off till the water rose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two hours to wait till the tide rises,&rdquo; grumbled
Jim Dale; &ldquo;just like the luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the time passed. But never for an instant
was the watch over the boys relaxed.
Tubby lay still, and Hiram, almost carried out of
himself by the rapid rush of recent events, leaned
miserably against the stay.</p>
<p>At last, just as a faint, gray light began to
show in the east, they could feel the sloop moving
under their feet. With reversed motor, she was
backed off the sand-bar, or mud-shoal, and the
journey resumed. As the light grew stronger,
Hiram saw that they were dropping rapidly down
toward the sea. Right ahead of them could now
be seen the white foam and spray, where the
breakers of the open sea were shattering themselves
on the bar at the mouth of the creek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The channel was narrow and intricate, but Jim
Dale, who seemed to be a good pilot, and who had
assumed the wheel, brought the sloop through it
in safety. Before long, under her keel could be
felt the long lift and drive of the open Atlantic.</p>
<p>By gazing at the sun, Hiram saw that the
sloop&rsquo;s head was pointed west. By this he judged
that her navigators meant to head down the
Long Island shore toward New York.</p>
<p>The sunrise was red and angry. Hiram, with
his knowledge of scout-lore, knew that this presaged
bad weather. But the crew of the sloop
did not seem to notice it. After a while they
began to make preparations to hoist sail, as the
breeze was freshening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take those kids below,&rdquo; ordered Stonington
Hunt suddenly. Under the escort of Jim Dale,
who had relinquished the wheel to Freeman Hunt
and Pete Bumpus, the lads&mdash;Tubby being carried&mdash;were
presently installed in a small, dark
cabin in the stern of the sloop. This done, the
companionway door was closed, and they heard
a key grate in a lock. They were prisoners, then,
at sea, on this mysterious sloop?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; groaned Hiram to himself, sinking
down on a locker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I guess the next thing to do is for me
to come to life, my valiant downeaster,&rdquo; cried
Tubby, springing erect from the corner into
which he had been thrown. The apparently badly
wounded lad seemed as active and chipper as
ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">ADRIFT IN THE STORM.</span></h2>
<p>At the same instant the sloop staggered and
heeled over, sending Hiram half across the dingy
cabin. He caught at a stanchion and saved himself.
Then he turned his amazed gaze afresh on
Tubby. The stout youth stood by the companion
stairs, regarding him with a grin. Presently he
actually began to hum:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A life on the ocean wave!</p>
<p class="t0">A home on the rolling deep!</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yo ho, my hearties,&rdquo; he added, with a nautical
twitch at his breeches, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to have a
rough day of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer, the sloop heeled over to another
puff. A tin dish, dislodged from the rusty
stove, went clattering across the inclined cabin
floor. But still Hiram stood gaping vacantly at
Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired that individual
cheerfully, &ldquo;have you lost that voice of
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, b-b-b-but I thought you were badly
wounded!&rdquo; Hiram managed to sputter.</p>
<div class="img" id="p078">
<img src="images/p078.jpg" alt="&ldquo;No, b-b-b-but I thought you were badly wounded!&rdquo; Hiram managed to sputter." width="500" height="785" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;No, b-b-b-but I thought you were badly wounded!&rdquo; Hiram managed to sputter.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I was, but in reverse English only,&rdquo; said
Tubby cheerfully; &ldquo;the bullet just nicked me and
knocked the breath out of me for a minute.
When I came to, I saw that the best thing I could
do was to act like Br&rsquo;er Rabbit and lay low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram looked his admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-al,&rdquo; he drawled, dropping, as he seldom
did even in emotional moments, into his New
England dialect, &ldquo;ef you ain&rsquo;t ther beatingist!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, say,&rdquo; he added quickly, &ldquo;what about that
red stain on your shirt? Look, it&rsquo;s all over the
front of your uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jiggeree, so it is. I guess that fountain pen
of mine must have been busted cold by that bullet.
I had it filled with red ink, because I&rsquo;d been
helping Rob fill out some reports to mail to Scout
headquarters. Ho! ho!&rdquo; the fat boy broke into
open mirth, &ldquo;it certainly does look as if some one
had tapped my claret. Yo-ho! that was a
corker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sloop lurched and dipped deeper than ever.
They could see the green water obscure the port
hole for an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sea&rsquo;s getting up right along,&rdquo; said
Tubby presently, as he unbound Hiram&rsquo;s hands.
&ldquo;Say, Hiram,&rdquo; he added anxiously, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
get seasick easily, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-n-n-no, that is, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; sputtered
Hiram rather dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t, I beg from my heart! Don&rsquo;t get
seasick till we get on land again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to,&rdquo; said the downeast boy seriously,
ignoring the fine &ldquo;bull&rdquo; which Tubby&rsquo;s remark
contained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me,&rdquo; said Tubby presently, &ldquo;of what
the sea captain said to the nervous lady. She
went up to him and told him that her husband
was scared of getting seasick. &lsquo;My husband&rsquo;s
dreadfully liable to seasickness, captain,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;What must I tell him to do if he feels it coming
on?&rsquo; &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell him anything, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
said the captain; &lsquo;no need to tell him what to do&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
do it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But somehow this bit of humor did not bring
even a wan smile to Hiram, willing as he usually
was to laugh at Tubby&rsquo;s whimsical jokes. Instead,
he turned a pale face on his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;do feel pretty bad, for a fact!&rdquo; he
moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jiminy Crickets!&rdquo; wailed Tubby, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
going to be seasick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram, with a ghastly face of a greenish-yellow
hue, sank down on one of the lockers, resigning
himself to his fate. The sloop began to
plunge and tumble along in a more lively fashion
than ever. Overhead Tubby could hear the
trample of feet, as her crew ran about trying to
weather the blow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Suddenly, above the howling of the wind,
Tubby heard a sharp click at the companionway
door. The next instant the companionway slide
was shoved back and a gust of fresh, salt-laden
air blew into the close cabin. Stonington Hunt&rsquo;s
form was on the stairway the next moment, and
Tubby, with a quick dive, threw himself on the
floor in a corner, carrying out once more his r&ocirc;le
of the badly wounded scout.</p>
<p>Lying there, and breathing in a quick, distressed
way, Tubby, out of the corner of his eye,
watched the man as he moved about. Hunt&rsquo;s
first idea was evidently to rouse Hiram. Perhaps
he needed him to help in navigating the
storm-buffeted craft. But he soon gave up the
task of instilling the seasick lad with ambition or
life. Then came Tubby&rsquo;s turn, but after bending
over the fat boy for an instant, Hunt muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; and without offering to aid
the supposedly injured boy, moved away. He
ascended the steps and presently the companion
slide banged to, and the padlock clicked once
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Tubby arose, as soon as he was convinced the
coast was clear, and, despairing of arousing Hiram,
sat on a locker and began to think hard.
Rather bitterly he went over in his mind the circumstances
leading to their present predicament.
In the first place, he could not but own he had had
no business to embark on such an enterprise at
all without a bigger force. In the second place,
if he had lived up to the Scouts&rsquo; motto of &ldquo;Be
Prepared,&rdquo; there was a strong possibility that
they would not have been so disastrously precipitated
through the roof of the lonely hut. However,
before long, Tubby&rsquo;s naturally buoyant temperament
asserted itself. As became a boy who
had won a first-class scoutship, he did not waste
any further time on vain regrets. Instead of
crying over spilled milk, he began to figure on
finding a way out of their predicament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Casting his eyes about the cabin, he suddenly
became aware of a small door in the bulkhead at
the forward end of it. Curious by nature, Tubby
opened it, and peered into a dark, cavernous
space. A strong odor of gasoline saluted his nostrils,
and presently&mdash;his eyes becoming used to
the light&mdash;he could make out the occasional glint
of metal. In a flash he realized that this was the
engine-room of the sloop, and housed her auxiliary
motor.</p>
<p>A button-switch being made out by the boy at
this moment, he turned it. Instantly two incandescent
lights shone out, illuminating the place.
By their light Tubby made out another door beyond
the motor. Determined to investigate the
sloop thoroughly&mdash;come what might&mdash;he thrust
it open, and found himself in what seemed to be
the hold. But it was too dark to perceive much.
Besides, the sloop was pitching and rolling so
terribly that the lad had all he could do to hold on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Returning to the engine-room, he almost stumbled
across an electric torch secured to a bracket
on the bulkhead. It was evidently used for examining
the motor without exposing an open
light to the fumes of the gasoline. Armed with
this, Tubby once more investigated the hold.
It was a capacious place. Stanchions, like a forest
of bare trees, supported the deck above. So
far as the boy could make out, the place was
empty. Far forward was a ladder leading up to
a hatchway. Tubby, following out his naturally
inquiring bent of mind, was about to examine
this, when his heart gave a great bound and then
stood still.</p>
<p>He had not thought to cast a glance behind
him in his eagerness to examine the hold.</p>
<p>This had proved to be a fatal bit of oversight
on his part, for Stonington Hunt and his son,
descending to the cabin for some purpose, had
observed his absence. A brief investigation
showed them the open door into the engine-room
and thence they had glimpsed the flash of Tubby&rsquo;s
torch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The boy turned, warned by some instinct, just
as they tiptoed up behind him. Freeman Hunt,
with a grin on his face, rushed straight at the
Boy Scout. But Tubby was prepared this time,
at any rate. He dashed the torch, end down, on
the floor of the hold, extinguishing it instantly.
At almost the same instant, he rushed straight
at the place where he had last seen Freeman
Hunt.</p>
<p>To his huge satisfaction, he felt the other go
down in a sprawling heap under his onrush. As
he fell, Freeman gave a shout of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t wounded at all, dad! He was fooling
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the brat! He was!&rdquo; shouted Stonington
Hunt, blundering about in the black hold and
striving to keep his footing on the pitching, heaving
floor.</p>
<p>Tubby, guided by instinct, dashed forward
toward the spot, as nearly as he could judge its
location, where he had noticed the ladder. He
found it, and had placed his foot on the bottom
rung, when there was a sudden shock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>The motion of the sloop seemed to cease, as if
by magic. Tubby felt himself hurled forward
into darkness by the shock. His head crashed
against something, and a world of brilliant constellations
swam in a glittering array before his
eyes. Then something in his head seemed to
give way with a snap, and young Hopkins knew
no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">EAGLES ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! Wonder what&rsquo;s become of those two
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt voiced the inquiry, as he and Rob
emerged from the police station. The sergeant
in charge had promised to do all he could to
apprehend the stealers of the pocketbook if they
were anywhere within striking distance of Aquebogue.</p>
<p>Rob looked about him. There stood the automobile.
But of the two lads they had left to
guard it there was no sign. After waiting a
reasonable time, the two Boy Scout leaders began
to feel real alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I feel as if Hunt and his gang have
got something to do with this,&rdquo; murmured Rob
uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem queer,&rdquo; admitted Merritt. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
look around a bit more, and then, if we find no
trace of them, we&rsquo;ll go back to the police station
and look for aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I guess that&rsquo;s the best thing to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as we know, it was impossible that their
search could terminate in anything but failure.
Not a little worried, Rob informed their friend,
the sergeant, of what had occurred. That official
at once galvanized into action. Before this, he
had not seemed to take much interest in their
affairs. But now he really moved quickly. By
telephone he summoned two detectives, and the
lads soon put them in possession of the facts in
the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty slim grounds to work on,&rdquo; remarked
one of them with a shrug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Rob could not but feel that this was true.
After their consultation with the detectives, who
at once set out to scour the place for some trace
of Hunt and his crew, the two lads, much dispirited,
and with heavy hearts, set out for home.
They arrived there in the early morning, and
turned in for a brief sleep. As Rob had expected,
his father was not at all pleased when he learned
of the nocturnal use made of his car, and of the
serious consequences which had ensued. But
Major Dangerfield, who had listened to the lad&rsquo;s
story with interest&mdash;it was related at the breakfast
table&mdash;was inclined to take a less serious
view of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, Mr. Blake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the boys behaved
like true Boy Scouts. It was their duty to
try to aid in the matter of the pocketbook, and
they did their best. I think that it was cleverly
done, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But young Hopkins and Hiram are missing,&rdquo;
protested Mrs. Blake. &ldquo;What will their parents
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, from my observation of Master
Hopkins, that he is the kind of lad to get into
serious difficulties,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;In fact, I
am convinced that he has stumbled across some
clew and is following it up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it may be so, and that both of them
are safe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blake fervently.</p>
<p>The first duty, after the morning meal, was to
call on Mrs. Hopkins, who was a widow, and also
on Hiram&rsquo;s parents, and explain the case. It was
not a pleasant task, but Rob saw it through with
Spartan courage. He succeeded in quelling the
first vivid alarm of the lads&rsquo; parents, however,
and promised to return with news of them before
the day was over. This done, Major Dangerfield,
Merritt and Rob set out in the Blake car for
Aquebogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your duty as Boy Scouts to find your
missing comrades,&rdquo; said Mr. Blake, as the car
started off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it, if it&rsquo;s possible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Merritt
dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it, anyway,&rdquo; said Rob stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right Scout way to talk,&rdquo; said the
major commendingly, &ldquo;that is the spirit that will
win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>No news greeted them on their arrival in Aquebogue.
The two detectives were still out on the
case, and the officials in charge had nothing to
report. This was discouraging, but before long
one of the detectives arrived with an important
clew. He carried in his hand a paper package.
On being opened, it proved to contain two pairs
of shoes, of Boy Scout pattern. Rob and Merritt
immediately identified them as belonging to
Hiram and young Hopkins. The major seemed
much impressed by the value of this bit of evidence,
and before many minutes had passed they
were all in the auto and spinning toward the spot
where the articles of apparel had been discovered.</p>
<p>The detectives, it transpired, had not yet explored
the hut, and Rob&rsquo;s keen eyes were the first
to spy the jagged hole in its roof. He at once
set his scout training to work. The first thing
he observed was that the hole had been freshly
torn. An investigation of the inside of the hut
showed the traces of the fight between Hiram
and young Hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>All at once Rob gave a sharp exclamation, and
pounced on some object in a corner of the place.
Its bright glitter, as the light fell on it through
the hole in the roof, had attracted him at first.
True Scout as he was, Rob did not allow even
the minutest object to escape his scrutiny. In
this case, he was richly rewarded, for what he
had seen turned out to be a Scout button. It
was one that had been torn from Hiram&rsquo;s coat
in the struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is conclusive evidence that the two lads
were here,&rdquo; decided the major. &ldquo;What else can
you deduce from what you have seen, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the Eagle Patrol pondered a
moment. Then he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; he said decidedly, &ldquo;it is
evident that Tubby and Hiram in some way got
on the track of our enemies in the town. They
followed them here. That is proved by the finding
of their shoes on that dune near the hut.
They took their shoes off for some object, of
course. Evidently it must have been to silently
observe the men who occupied this shanty. By
looking at the footmarks in the sand outside, I
traced them to the wall of the place. The steps
did not turn in at the door, therefore, obviously,
they must have climbed on the roof, for the steps
ended at the low-hanging eaves, and they do not
go back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An examination of the roof shows that it
must have given way under their combined
weight. See, that beam is as brittle as match-wood,
from dry rot. They could not have been
hurt&mdash;at least, I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;or this button,
which must have been torn off in a struggle, for
they are tightly sewn on, would not have been
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; approved the major. &ldquo;I have
seen Indian scouts on the border who could not
have done much better. But what is the next
step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To find out what has become of them, of
course,&rdquo; put in Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see how close we can come to deciding
that,&rdquo; said the major, with a side glance
at the detectives, who seemed puzzled and bewildered
at the swift deductive work of the young
Scout.</p>
<p>Merritt left the hut and made a hasty examination
of the numerous tracks without. He then
scrutinized the muddy banks of the inlet closely.
The tide was not yet full, and the marks of the
sloop&rsquo;s keel still showed. Also sand had been
tracked on to the little wharf. It was evident
that a vessel of some sort had lain there between
tides. Equally plain did it appear, that the two
missing lads had been carried on board her.
Merritt lost no time in communicating his discoveries
to his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; commended the former
army officer, &ldquo;I am convinced that your deductions
are, in the main, correct. But now the
thing is to get some craft to go in pursuit of
these fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ike Menjes, up the creek a little way, has a
big gasoline launch he lets out,&rdquo; volunteered one
of the detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get it if possible,&rdquo; said the major instantly.
&ldquo;Is she a fast boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None quicker hereabouts,&rdquo; said the other arm
of the law.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later a bargain had been struck,
and with Ike Menjes at the engine, and Rob at
the wheel, the swift launch <i>Algonquin</i> was dashing
off down the winding creek headed for the
open sea. As she tumbled and rolled through
the rough waters of the bar at the creek&rsquo;s mouth,
Rob&rsquo;s eye swept the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad weather coming,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to worry in this craft,&rdquo; declared Ike;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s weathered the worst we ever get off here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo; agreed the major, with an approving
glance at the craft&rsquo;s broad lines and generous
beam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Before many moments had passed, Rob&rsquo;s prediction
came true. The <i>Algonquin</i>, without any
diminution of speed, was being pushed along
through a rapidly rising sea, while the wind
howled about her, growing stronger every moment.
Rob caught himself wondering what sort
of a craft the kidnappers of the boys possessed.
He hoped it was staunch, for in his judgment the
blow was going to be a bad one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll get worser before it gets betterer,&rdquo;
opined Ike Menjes, coming forward from his
engines and peering ahead at the tumbling
masses of green water. The rising wind caught
their tops and feathered them off in masses of
snowy spume. Overhead, dark, ragged clouds
raced along. So low did they hang that they
seemed almost to touch the crests of the angry
waves.</p>
<p>Each time the <i>Algonquin</i> topped a roller and
then staggered down into a deep trough, Rob
scanned the surrounding sea eagerly. But no
sign, had, so far, appeared, of any craft resembling
the one which they knew must have left
the creek. Seaward some sails showed, but they
were all those of large coasting schooners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>The craft they were in search of was, no
doubt, a smallish vessel, otherwise she could not
have negotiated the narrow, winding creek, with
its innumerable bends and shallow places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep more in shore,&rdquo; advised Ike. &ldquo;They
may have hugged the land to get the benefit of
the weather shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob headed closer in toward the low-lying
coast. He could see the waves breaking angrily
in white masses on the sandy beach. All at
once, above a distant point of land, he sighted the
gray shoulder of a sail. The next instant it had
vanished.</p>
<p>Had it found an opening through which to slip
into an inlet in the bleak coast, or had it foundered
in the wild breakers?</p>
<p>The question agitated Rob hugely. Some intuition
told him that the craft he had glimpsed
had been the one they were in search of, but of
its fate they could have no immediate knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT SCOUT HOPKINS DID.</span></h2>
<p>When young Hopkins came to himself, he was
dimly conscious that the driving motion of the
sloop had ceased. Instead, lying there in the
pitchy darkness of the hold, he could feel the
vessel being struck with what appeared to be
mighty blows from a Titanic hammer. Tubby
guessed instantly, from the sensations, that they
were aground, and that what he felt was the terrific
bombardment of enormous breakers.</p>
<p>A swift &ldquo;overhauling&rdquo; of himself soon showed
the lad that he was not hurt, although the blow
on his head, when he had been hurled from the
ladder, had stunned him. Of how long he had
been unconscious, he had, of course, no knowledge.
Worse still, he could not form any idea of
how to get out of his dark prison, and he realized
that he had no time to lose if he wanted to save
Hiram and himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Risking the chance that their enemies were
prowling about, waiting for the lad to declare
himself, Tubby set up a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiram! Oh, Hiram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the intervals of the crashing blows that
shook the frail sloop from stem to stern, Tubby
listened intently. But for some time no answering
cry came to greet him. Then all at once he
thought he caught a feeble shout. He responded,
and the cry came more distinctly.
Guided by it, he made his way aft with considerable
difficulty. Presently a dim, gray light, filtering
through the blackness, apprised him that
he was nearing the door in the bulkhead through
which he had blundered into the hold. A moment
more and he had passed through the engine-room
and was in the cabin. Hiram, looking pale
and wild, was clinging to a stanchion. Water
had come into the cabin through a broken port,
and was washing about the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tubby, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come. Where
have you been?&rdquo; breathed the unfortunate Hiram,
weak and shaky from his bout with seasickness.
&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re aground somewhere,&rdquo; rejoined
Tubby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made for the companionway and rattled the
door at the top. As he had dreaded, it was
locked. They were prisoners on board a doomed
vessel. For an instant even young Hopkins&rsquo; resourcefulness
came to a standstill. His heart
seemed to stop beating. His head swam madly.
Was this to be the end of them, to be drowned
miserably, like two captive rats?</p>
<p>But the next instant the thought of their plight
acted as a stimulus. &ldquo;A true Scout should never
say die,&rdquo; thought the boy, and then, retracing his
steps, he joined Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of Hunt and his outfit?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Stonington Hunt and Freeman passed
through the cabin a few minutes ago,&rdquo; replied
Hiram, &ldquo;right after that terrible bump&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the sloop struck,&rdquo; thought Tubby.
Aloud he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard them say that you were done for, and
that I could be left to drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Hiram; but did they say anything
about escaping themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I heard them shouting on deck to cut
loose the boat. Then I heard a lot of noise. I
guess they launched her. That&rsquo;s all, till I heard
you shouting back in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated Tubby; &ldquo;so they left us
to perish on this old sloop, eh? Well, Hiram,
we&rsquo;ll fool &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll get away yet in spite of
them.&rdquo; In talking thus, young Hopkins assumed
a confidence he was far from feeling, but he
deemed it best to stimulate Hiram with hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any matches?&rdquo; was his next question.</p>
<p>Hiram nodded, and presently handed out a
box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now follow me. By the way, how&rsquo;s
the seasickness?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, better, but I feel shaky yet. I can manage,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff&mdash;wough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavier blow than usual had been dealt the
sloop. The two lads could feel her quiver and
quake under the concussion like a live thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ve got to move quick,&rdquo; said
Tubby. Striking a match, he set off into the hold.
Hiram followed. Before long they stood at the
foot of the ladder from which Tubby had been
so violently flung a short time before.</p>
<p>The stout youth darted up it with an agility
one would not have expected in a boy of his
girth. With the strongest shove of which he
was capable, he pushed up the scuttle above.</p>
<p>To his great joy, it gave, swinging back on
hinges. But, as he opened it fully, Tubby came
nearly being hurled from the ladder for the second
time. A great mass of green water swept
across the deck at that instant, and the full force
of the torrent descended into the hole through the
open hatch. Luckily, Tubby had seen it coming
in time to warn Hiram, and the downeast lad
clung on tightly enough to avoid being carried
from his foothold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>In a jiffy young Hopkins clambered through,
shouting to Hiram to follow him. It was a wild
scene that met both boys&rsquo; eyes when they emerged
on the deck of the stranded sloop. She lay in a
small inlet which, though partially sheltered, in
hard storms was swept by the seas from outside.
The sloop was heeled over to one side at so steep
an angle that standing on her wet decks was impossible
without clinging to something.</p>
<p>About three hundred yards away lay the shore,
a wild, uninhabited expanse of wind-swept sand
dunes, overgrown with dull, green and prickly
beach-grass. No sign of a human habitation
could be discerned. Outside on the beach the big
seas thundered, flinging masses of white foam
skyward. It seemed almost impossible that she
could have been navigated through the narrow
inlet leading into the small bay where she had
stranded. As a matter of fact, it had been more
by luck than by design that she had accomplished
the passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>All at once, as the two castaways stood looking
about them, a figure bobbed up from behind one
of the sand hills. It was instantly recognized by
Tubby as Stonington Hunt. The lad now saw
that a boat lay on the beach; evidently then, that
was how they had reached the shore, as Hiram
had surmised. Hunt had apparently been seeking
shelter from the storm behind the dune, with
the rest of his band. As his eyes fell on the figures
of the two Boy Scouts standing on the deck
of the stranded sloop, he beckoned toward the
dune. Instantly there appeared the rest of the
lads&rsquo; enemies.</p>
<p>They stood staring for a few minutes, as if
amazed to see the Boy Scouts. But before they
had time to take any action, an astonishing thing
happened.</p>
<p>The sloop began to move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>The incoming tide, which had been steadily
rising, had floated her, and she gradually reeled
off the sand bank, on which she had struck, into
open water. As she did so, Tubby suddenly
ducked low, and something whistled by his head.
Above the wind came the crack of a firearm&rsquo;s report.
Gazing toward Stonington Hunt, Tubby
saw that the man held a revolver in his hand. It
was from this weapon, evidently, that the projectile
had been discharged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way, Hiram, quick!&rdquo; exclaimed
the stout lad, for he now saw that the others were
preparing to discharge pistols at them. It was
apparent that they did not mean the boys to
escape if they could avoid it.</p>
<p>But Tubby had suddenly thought of a plan. It
had been born in his mind when the sloop rolled
off the shoal into deep water. He knew something
of gasoline engines from his experiences
on board the <i>Flying Fish</i>. Why would it
not be possible to get out of the little and dangerous
bay under motor power? The shots hastened
his decision. Clearly if they remained where they
were, destruction swift and certain threatened.
Stonington Hunt did not mean to let them land,
so much was only too apparent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Before the men left the sloop they had hauled
down the canvas, probably in an effort to keep
her from grounding. It was the work of an instant
for Tubby to dash below and give a turn to
the rear starting device on the engine. It worked
perfectly. Then he turned on the gasolene, easily
finding the connection, and threw on the
switch. A blue spark showed that the current
was on. Then, with a beating heart he turned
the starting device once more.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>The engine moved. To the lad&rsquo;s delight it
worked steadily. This done, he darted back on
deck and took the wheel. He was not a moment
too soon, for, with no one at the helm, the craft
was heading once more for the sand bank.
Crouching beneath the stern bulwarks, and ordering
Hiram to do the same, young Hopkins
navigated the sloop skilfully ahead, steering
straight for the open sea. Tempestuous as it
was, the sloop seemed still staunch, and he felt
they were safer there than in such close proximity
to Hunt. Especially since they were followed
by an unceasing fire from the pistols of the gang.
But although some of the shots splintered the bulwarks,
sending showers of slivers about the two
crouching lads, neither were hit.</p>
<p>At last, after a dozen hair-raising escapes on
the choppy bar, the sloop gained the outside, and
throwing showers of spray high over her bluff
bows, began to breast the sweep of the seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go below and take a look at the glass oil
cups,&rdquo; ordered Tubby as soon as they were safe
from the firing, &ldquo;if any of them are empty fill
them. There is an oil can on a shelf beside the
motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glad to do anything to help out, Hiram hastened
on this errand. He was below about ten
minutes. When he returned on deck his face
was white, and he was breathing quickly. Tubby&rsquo;s
quick eye noted, too, that the lad was wet to
the waist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up below?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabin&rsquo;s half full of water, and it seems
to be rising every minute;&rdquo; was the disquieting
reply.</p>
<p>At the same instant the sloop&rsquo;s motion
stopped and she began rolling in a sickening
fashion in the troughs of the mighty seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jehoshaphat!&rdquo; exclaimed Scout Hopkins,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re in for it now. The water&rsquo;s reached the
engine and it&rsquo;s stopped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke a gigantic mountain of green
water suddenly towered right above the helpless
sloop. Its crest seemed to overtop the mast tip.
Automatically Tubby crouched low and reached
out a hand for Hiram.</p>
<p>The next instant the wave swept down on them
enveloping the lads in a turmoil of salt water.
The two boys were swept away in the liquid avalanche
like feathers before a gale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>When the wave had passed, the wreck of the
sloop could be seen staggering and wallowing
like a stricken thing. But of her two recent occupants
there was no trace upon the wilderness
of heaving waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">A RESCUE AND A BIVOUAC.</span></h2>
<p>From the bow of the <i>Algonquin</i> Rob kept his
eyes riveted on the spot at which he had seen
the sloop vanish. But for some time he could see
nothing but the billowing crests of the waves.
Suddenly, to his astonishment, from the midst
of the combing summits, there was revealed the
swaying mast of the sloop, cutting great arcs
dizzily across the lowering sky.</p>
<p>As the <i>Algonquin</i> climbed to a wave top the
entire length of the sloop was disclosed to the
lad&rsquo;s gaze. On her deck he could now plainly
see two figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a glass?&rdquo; he inquired of Ike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; responded that individual, floundering
forward with a pair of binoculars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Rob clapped them to his eyes. The figures of
Hiram and Tubby Hopkins swam into the field
of vision. At the same instant, or so it seemed,
Rob made out the wall of green water rushing
downward upon the sloop.</p>
<p>While a cry of alarm still quivered upon his
lips, the sloop rallied an instant, and then&mdash;was
wiped out!</p>
<p>The others had pressed forward too, and the
<i>Algonquin</i> had, by that time, gotten close enough
for them all to witness the marine tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Rob,&rdquo; exclaimed the major, his hand
on Rob&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;they may be all right yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s face was white and set, but he nodded
bravely. It seemed impossible that anything
living could have escaped from the overwhelming
avalanche of water.</p>
<p>Merritt seized the glasses as Rob set them
down to take the wheel again. He peered
through them with straining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s that off in the water there?&rdquo; he
shouted suddenly, pointing.</p>
<p>The next instant the object he had descried had
vanished in the trough of a sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could you make out anybody?&rdquo; asked the
major anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked like a spar with&mdash;Yes, there are two
figures clinging to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me look!&rdquo; Rob snatched the glasses
out of his comrade&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; he cried the next instant, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
Tubby and Hiram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked the major, &ldquo;perhaps it&rsquo;s
some members of Hunt&rsquo;s crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Tubby and Hiram. I can make out
their uniforms,&rdquo; cried Rob. As he spoke he
swung the wheel over, and the <i>Algonquin&rsquo;s</i> head
was turned in the direction of the spot where a
spar with two objects clinging to it had last been
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what can have become of Hunt and
his crowd?&rdquo; said Merritt presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve met with a watery grave,&rdquo;
conjectured one of the detectives, &ldquo;and from
what you&rsquo;ve told me it would be a good end for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they hain&rsquo;t taken that pocket-book with
them,&rdquo; put in his companion, &ldquo;the kidnapping
of those boys was as desperate a bit of work
as I&rsquo;ve ever heard tell of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a brief time the two lads, none the worse apparently
for their immersion, had been hauled on
board the <i>Algonquin</i>, and were being plied with
eager questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I caught on to that boom more by
instinct than anything else,&rdquo; explained Tubby,
&ldquo;when I got the water out of my lungs I looked
about me and saw that Hiram had grabbed it
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call luck,&rdquo; said one of the detectives
in a wondering tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely was,&rdquo; agreed Hiram, &ldquo;but I guess
there&rsquo;s a bigger bit coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the major, struck
by something odd in the lad&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>For answer Tubby thrust a hand into an inside
pocket of his coat and drew forth something
that, dripping with water as it was, could be
easily recognized as&mdash;the missing pocket-book!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<div class="img" id="p116">
<img src="images/p116.jpg" alt="Tubby drew forth the missing pocket-book." width="500" height="804" />
<p class="center">Tubby drew forth the missing pocket-book.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they forgot to search me for it in the
excitement following the collapse of the roof.
I&rsquo;m sorry it got wet, major,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>But the major and the others could only regard
the fat boy with wondering eyes. Suddenly the
major, the first to recover his senses, spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m ever to thank you for
this, Hopkins&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you how you can,&rdquo; spoke the irrepressible
Tubby swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By taking us some place where we can get
something to eat,&rdquo; quoth Tubby, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry
I could demolish the left hind leg of a brass
monkey without winking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>From the tumbling waves of an angry sea to
the cool shadows of a magnificent forest of chestnut
and oak may be a long distance to travel,
but such is the jump over time and space that
we must make if we wish to accompany our Boy
Scouts to their Mountain Camp. The evening
sun, already almost touching the peaks of the
nearest range, was striking level shafts of light
through the forest as our party came to a halt,
and Major Dangerfield ordered the canoes, by
which they had traversed the smooth stretches
of Echo Lake, hauled ashore.</p>
<p>It was more than three days since the party
had left the shores of Lake Champlain. The
passage of the lake from its lower end had been
made by canoes. The same craft they were now
using had transported them. There were three
of the frail, delicate little vessels. One was blue,
another a rich Indian red, and the third a dark
green.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The canoes had been purchased by Major Dangerfield
at Lakehead, a small town at which they
left the railroad. They had been stocked with
provisions and equipment for their long dash
into the solitudes of the Adirondacks. Reaching
Dangerfield, the canoes had been transported
overland till the first of a chain of lakes, leading
into the interior, had been reached. Here, to
the boys&rsquo; huge delight, they once more took to
the water.</p>
<p>In the party were Rob, Merritt, young Hopkins,
Hiram and little Andy Bowles, the bugler
of the Eagles. Andy had been brought along
because, as Rob had said, he was so little he
would tuck in anywhere. Of course there had
been keen regret on the part of the lads who
were, of necessity, left behind. But they had
borne it with true scout spirit and wished their
lucky comrades all the good fortune in the world,
when they embarked from Hampton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Travel had bronzed the lads and stained and
crumpled their smart uniforms. But they looked
very fit and scout-like as they bustled about, making
the various preparations for the evening&rsquo;s
camp. Two members of the party have not yet
been mentioned. One of these was a tall, lanky
man with a pair of big horn-rimmed spectacles
set athwart his nose, and arrayed in a queer combination
of woodsman&rsquo;s clothes and a pedant&rsquo;s
immaculate dress. He had retained a white lawn
tie and long black coat, but his nether limbs were
encased in corduroys and gaiters, with a pair of
big, square-toed shoes protruding beneath. On
his head was an odd-looking round, black hat,
which was always getting knocked into the water
or caught on branches and swept off. This queer
figure was Professor Jeremiah Jorum.</p>
<p>The second addition to the party was the major&rsquo;s
factotum, Christopher Columbus Julius
Pompey Snaggs. But for purposes of identification
he answered to the name of Jumbo. Jumbo
was a big-framed negro, intensely black and with
a sunny, child-like disposition. He had a propensity
for coining words to suit his convenience,
deeming the King&rsquo;s English insufficient in scope
to express his emotions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Standing on the sandy strip of beach as he
emerged from the red canoe, with a load of
&ldquo;duffle,&rdquo; Jumbo gazed about him in an interested
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis sutt&rsquo;in&rsquo;ly am a glumpferiferous spot to
locate a camp,&rdquo; he remarked, letting his big eyes
roll from the tranquil expanse of lake, fringed
with feathery balsams and firs, to the slope above
him clothed in its growth of fine timber, some of
it hundreds of years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you, Jumbo, hurry up with that bedding
and then clean those fish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was the major&rsquo;s. It hailed from a
level spot a short distance above the sandy beach.
On this small plateau, the canvas &ldquo;tepees&rdquo; the
Boy Scouts carried were already erected, and a
good fire was burning between two green logs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas, sah, yas, sah! I&rsquo;se a comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; hailed the
negro, lumbering up among the loose rock, and
almost spilling his load in his haste, &ldquo;I&rsquo;se a coming
so quintopulous dat you all kain&rsquo;t see muh
fer de dus&rsquo; I&rsquo;se raisin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Before long the fish, caught by trolling as
they came along, were frizzling in the pan, and
spreading an appetizing odor abroad. The aroma
of coffee and camp biscuit mingled with the
other appetizing smells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Race anybody down to the lake for a wash!&rdquo;
shouted Rob suddenly.</p>
<p>In a flash he was off, followed by Merritt,
Hiram and Tubby. Little Andy Bowles, with
his bugle suspended from his shoulders by a cord
of the Eagle colors, hurried along behind on
his stumpy little legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I win!&rdquo; shouted Rob as he, with difficulty,
paused on the brink of the lake. But hardly
were the words out of his mouth before Merritt
flashed up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost a dead heat,&rdquo; laughed Rob, &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;But
hullo, what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above them came a roar of sliding gravel and
stones that sounded like an avalanche. In the
midst of it was Tubby, his rotund form dashing
forward at a great rate. His legs were flashing
like the pistons of a racing locomotive as he
plunged down the hillside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, stop! stop!&rdquo; shouted Rob, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be in
the lake in a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the warning came too late. Tubby&rsquo;s heavy
weight could not be checked so easily. Faster
he went, and faster, striving in vain to stop himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; yelled Merritt the next instant,
as a splash announced that Tubby had plunged
into the lake water.</p>
<p>In a flash the fat boy was on the surface. But
he was &ldquo;dead game,&rdquo; and while his comrades
shouted with laughter he swam about, puffing
like a big porpoise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in, the water&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even with your uniform on?&rdquo; jeered Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Oh-ouch! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat boy had perceived a queer-looking
head suddenly obtrude from the water close to
him. It was evident that he was not the only
one to enjoy an evening swim that day. A big
water snake was sharing his involuntary bath
with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Tubby struck out with might and main for
shore, and presently reached it, dripping profusely.
The major, when he heard of the occurrence,
ordered a change of clothes. When this had
been made, Andy&rsquo;s bugle sounded the quick lively
notes of the mess call, and the Boy Scouts and
their elders gathered round the table which the
boys&rsquo; deft hands had composed of flat slabs of
birch bark supported on trestles of green wood.
They sat on camp stools which they carried with
them. How heartily they ate! They had the
appetites that are born of woods and open places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah goodness, dose boys mus&rsquo; have stumicks
lak der olyphogenius mammaothstikuscudsses!&rdquo;
exclaimed Jumbo as he hurried to and from his
cooking fire in response to constant demands for
&ldquo;more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE MOUNTAIN CAMP.</span></h2>
<p>Supper concluded, the talk naturally fell to the
object of their expedition. The chart or map of
the treasure-trove&rsquo;s location was brought out and
pored over in the firelight, for the nights were
quite sharp, and a big fire had been lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon do you think we will be within
striking distance of the place?&rdquo; inquired Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within two or three days, I should estimate,&rdquo;
replied the former officer, &ldquo;but of course we may
be delayed. For instance, we have a portage
ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-a&mdash;how much?&rdquo; asked Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A portage. That means a point of land round
which it would not be practicable to canoe. At
such a place we shall have to take the canoes out
of the water and carry them over the projection
of land to the next lake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody who wants it can have my share of
that job,&rdquo; said Tubby, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll delegate Andy
Bowles to carry out my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at the idea of what
a comical sight the diminutive bugler would present
staggering along under the weight of a
canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy would look like a little-neck clam under
its shell,&rdquo; chuckled Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t always gauge the quality
of the goods by the size of the package they
come in,&rdquo; chortled Andy, &ldquo;look at Tubby, for
instance. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fat boy suddenly projected himself on
the little bugler. But Andy, though small, was
tough as a roll of barbed wire. He resisted the
fat lad&rsquo;s attack successfully and the two
struggled all over the level place on which the
camp had been pitched.</p>
<p>Finally, however, they approached so near to
the edge that Rob interfered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll roll down the slope into the lake in
another minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Two baths a day
would be too much for Tubby. Besides, he&rsquo;d
raise the water and swamp the canoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat youth, with a pretence of outraged
dignity, sought his tepee and engaged himself in
cleaning his twenty-two rifle. After a while,
though, he emerged from his temporary obscurity,
and joined the group about the fire, who were
happily discussing plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good thing is that we have plenty of
arms,&rdquo; volunteered Hiram, &ldquo;in case Hunt and
his gang attack us we can easily keep them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor,
&ldquo;surely you don&rsquo;t contemplate any such unlawful
acts, major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As shooting at folks you mean,&rdquo; laughed the
major. &ldquo;No indeed, my dear professor. But if
those rascals attack us I hope we shall be able
to tackle them without any other weapons than
those nature has given us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I owe Freeman Hunt a good punch,&rdquo; muttered
Tubby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make the dust fly
around his heels with this rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, you talk like a regular &lsquo;Alkali
Ike&rsquo;,&rdquo; grinned Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet you I could hit an apple at two hundred
yards with this rifle, anyway,&rdquo; asserted the stout
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet my hunting knife you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll try to-morrow. This rifle is
a dandy, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! It won&rsquo;t carry a hundred yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t, eh? It&rsquo;ll carry half a mile, the man
who sold it to me said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minds me uv er gun my uncle had daown in
Virginny,&rdquo; put in Jumbo who had been an interested
listener, &ldquo;that thar gun was ther mos&rsquo; umbliquitos
gun I ever hearn&rsquo; tell uv.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a long distance shooter, eh?&rdquo; laughed
the major, scenting some fun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Long distance, sah! Why, majah, sah, dat
gun hadn&rsquo;t no ekil fo&rsquo; long distancenessness.
Dat gun &rsquo;ud shoot&mdash;it &rsquo;ud shoot de eye out uv
er lilly fly des as fur as you could see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would, really, Jumbo?&rdquo; inquired Andy
Bowles, deeply interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sho&rsquo; would fer sartain shuh, Massa
Bowles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; scoffed Tubby, with
a wink at the others. The fun-loving youth
scented a joke. &ldquo;My uncle had a gun that once
killed a deer at three miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At free miles, Massa Hopkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It sounds incredible I know, but they
had the state surveyor measure off the ground
and sure enough it was three miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Jumbo, blinking at the
fire, &ldquo;dat&rsquo;s a wun&rsquo;ful gun shoh &rsquo;nuff. But mah
uncle&rsquo;s gun hed it beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible, Jumbo!&rdquo; exclaimed the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas, sah, it deed. Mah uncle&rsquo;s gun done
cahhey so fah dat mah uncle he done hed ter put
salt on his bullets befo&rsquo; he fahed dem.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put salt on his bullets before he fired them,
Jumbo! What on earth for?&rdquo; demanded Rob
while the others bent forward interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; becos of de distance at which dat rifle
killed,&rdquo; explained Jumbo. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; see, and especially
in warm weather, dat salt was needed, &rsquo;cos
it took mah uncle such a time te git to it after
he done kill it dat if those bullets weren&rsquo;t salted
the game would hev spoiled. Yes, sah, da&rsquo;s a
fac&rsquo;, majah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dead silence fell over the camp at the conclusion
of this interesting narrative. You could
have heard a pin drop. At last the major said,
in a solemn voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumbo, I fear you are an exaggerator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah specs&rsquo; ah is, majah. I specs&rsquo; ah is, but
you know dat zaggerators is bo&rsquo;n and not made,
lak potes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the laughter broke loose. The hillside
echoed with it, and Jumbo, who deemed that he
had been called a most complimentary term by
the major, gazed from one to the other in a
highly puzzled way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me of old Uncle Hank who keeps a
grocery store near my uncle&rsquo;s farm up in Vermont,&rdquo;
put in Hiram. &ldquo;One night in the store
they were talking about potato bugs. One old
fellow said he had seen twenty potato bugs on
one stalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo; said an old man named Abner
Deene, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s nothing. Why, up in my potato
patch they&rsquo;ve eaten everything up and now when
I go outdoors I kin see &rsquo;em sitting around the
lot, on trees and fences, waitin&rsquo; fer me ter plant
over ag&rsquo;in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it came the turn of an old fellow named
Cyrus Harper. Cyrus laughed at Abner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sittin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; on fences,&rsquo; he sniffed, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
nuffin&rsquo;. Nuffin&rsquo; at all. Why whar I come from
the potato bugs come right into the kitchen, open
the oven doors and yank the red hot baking potatoes
out of the stove.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle hadn&rsquo;t said a thing all this time,
but now he struck in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;all these potato-bug
stories don&rsquo;t begin to compare with the breed
they had down near Brattleboro, where I come
from. Down there I used to clerk in Si Toner&rsquo;s
grocery and general store. Well, the potato bugs
used to come into the store in the spring and look
over Si&rsquo;s books to see who&rsquo;d been buying potato
seed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny thing your uncle never met the wonderful
rifle shot, Philander Potts,&rdquo; said the professor
musingly, after the laughter over Hiram&rsquo;s
yarn had subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philander Potts,&rdquo; exclaimed the boys, &ldquo;never
heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said the professor musingly, &ldquo;he
was the best shot in the world, too, I guess.
Why, once he undertook to fire at a rubber target
2,000 times in two minutes. The way he did it
was this. He had a repeating rifle and kept firing
as fast as he could at the india-rubber target.
The bullets would bounce off and he caught
them in the muzzle of his rifle as they flew back
and fired them over again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the bullets that were coming
out? Didn&rsquo;t they collide with the ones coming
back?&rdquo; asked Andy Bowles in all seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the professor gravely, &ldquo;you see,
Philander was so swift in his movements that
he was able to fire and catch alternately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to practice that,&rdquo; laughed Tubby.</p>
<p>Soon after the narration of this surprising anecdote,
the major looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;nine o&rsquo;clock.
Time for lights out. Andy, sound &lsquo;Taps&rsquo; and
we&rsquo;ll post the sentries for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby and Hiram were selected for the first
watch. The major and young Andy were to
stand the second vigil while the third period of
sentry duty fell to Merritt and Rob. It seemed
to the latter that they had not been asleep half
an hour when the major entered their tepee and
aroused them for their tour of duty. He reported
all quiet, and a clear moonlight night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Hastily throwing on their uniforms the Boy
Scouts turned out. For some time they paced
their posts steadfastly without anything occurring
to mar the stillness of the night. The moon
shone down brightly, silvering the surface of the
lake which could be glimpsed through the dark
trees.</p>
<p>Suddenly Rob, who had reached the limit of
his post, which was not far from where the
canoes had been hauled up, was startled by a
slight sound. It ceased almost instantly, but
presently it occurred again.</p>
<p>Cautiously the boy crept through the forest
toward the water&rsquo;s edge. He took every advantage
of his scout training and carefully avoided
treading on twigs or anything that might cause
a sound of his approach to be made manifest.</p>
<p>Gliding from tree trunk to tree trunk he soon
arrived at the spot in which the canoes had been
dragged ashore. At the same instant he became
aware of several dark figures moving about
among them. Suddenly, right behind him, a twig
snapped. In the stillness it sounded as loud as
the report of a pistol. Rob wheeled round swiftly,
but not before a figure leaped toward him
from behind a tree trunk. Before Rob could
raise a hand in self-defense another form sprang
at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>The lad tried to cry out and discharge his rifle,
but before he could accomplish either act he was
felled by some heavy instrument, and a gag
thrust into his mouth. The next instant, bound
and incapable of uttering a sound, he was borne
swiftly toward the canoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">CAPTURED.</span></h2>
<p>But silently as the attack upon Rob had been
made, it had not taken place without causing
some disturbance. Moreover, the sharp crack of
the snapping twig which had attracted Rob&rsquo;s
attention to his trailers, had also reached Merritt&rsquo;s
sharp ears. In the silence of the night-enwrapped
forest sounds carry far.</p>
<p>Merritt was all attention in a flash. The snap
of the twig might have been caused by some
prying animal or&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! That&rsquo;s the scuffling of feet!&rdquo; exclaimed
the young sentry the next moment as
the sounds of the tussle came to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>His first act was to fire a shot. It should have
been aimed in the air, but in his excitement Merritt
fired low. The bullet whizzed in the direction
of the camp, struck a tin kettle which was piled
up with a number of other tin utensils, and
brought the whole pile down with a crash. Now
Jumbo&rsquo;s chosen sleeping place was right behind
this barricade of tin hardware. When it fell it
came crashing about the colored man in an ear-splitting
avalanche. Jumbo leaped to his feet
with a howl. He was attired in his shirt,
trousers and shoes, not having bothered to remove
these when he retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo; de lan&rsquo;s sake what dat gum gophulous
racket?&rdquo; he yelled. In a flash his long legs began
to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rsquo;ll bet a pint uv peanuts dat&rsquo;s Injuns!&rdquo; he
shouted as he sped along, &ldquo;mah goodness, ah
wish ah had mah uncle&rsquo;s gun. But as ah ain&rsquo;t
ah&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; a gwine te trus&rsquo; ter mah laigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumbo, in great leaps and strides, arrived at
the lake-side in a few instants. In the meantime,
the camp behind him was in an uproar of excitement
over the midnight alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The negro had already reached the waterside
before he felt himself knocked flat by a heavy
blow on the head. Now Jumbo&rsquo;s head, like all
negroes&rsquo;, was about as hard as a bit of adamant.
But the cowardly fellow deemed it better to lie
perfectly still when he was knocked flat. Presently
he felt himself being picked up and thrown
into something that the next instant began to
move off. He realized in a flash that he was
lying in the bottom of one of the canoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hailp! Hailp!&rdquo; he began to yell, but was
silent instantly as a harsh voice breathed in his
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shut up if you don&rsquo;t want a bullet in
your black head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumbo lay silent after that. But his thoughts
were busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullet in mah haid, eh?&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;mah
goodness, ah don&rsquo;t want nuffin&rsquo; lak dat. Mah
cocoanut feels now laik ah&rsquo;d done tried ter butt
a locusmocus off&rsquo;n de track. Wondah what deportentiousness
uv all dis unusualauness done
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>His meditations were interrupted by a shout
from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring back those canoes at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah goodness, dat am de majah,&rdquo; exclaimed
Jumbo, but to himself. &ldquo;He shuh am po&rsquo;ful mad.
Wondah if dem boys is playin&rsquo; pranks. If dey
is dey&rsquo;ll be sorry fer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black ventured to raise his head a little
and peep up to see who was in the canoe with
him. In doing so his eyes fell on another figure
lying beside him. In the moonlight he could see
the cords that bound it. The radiance of the
moon also revealed the Boy Scout uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel&rsquo;s Ho&rsquo;hn! Dat&rsquo;s one of dem Boy
Scrouts!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;an&rsquo; mah gracious, ah
wondah who dat fierce lookin&rsquo; man am whose
paddlin&rsquo; dis yar boat. Reckon ah&rsquo;d better lay
quiet. He looks pretty frambunctious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>In the meantime, the aroused inmates of the
camp had rushed to the shore. They reached
it just in time to see their entire flotilla of canoes
being paddled swiftly off across the smooth,
moonlit waters. Tubby and Hiram raised their
rifles when a hoarse laugh of defiance greeted
the major&rsquo;s command to the marauders to halt.
But in a flash the officer saw what they were
about to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that, boys,&rdquo; he ordered sharply, &ldquo;put
down those rifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use for them now,&rdquo; grumbled Tubby,
&ldquo;see, they&rsquo;ve disappeared round that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get after them,&rdquo; suggested Hiram.</p>
<p>The major shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over this rough ground they could easily outdistance
us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is anyone missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took but a few minutes to ascertain that
both Rob and Jumbo were not among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is even more serious than the theft of
the canoes,&rdquo; exclaimed the professor, &ldquo;do you
suppose that it was Hunt&rsquo;s gang that took
them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;who else
would be interested in annoying us? But let&rsquo;s
hear Merritt&rsquo;s story. What did you hear, my
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt soon told his narrative of the crackling
twig and the struggle. A visit to the beach
showed that there had, indeed, been a struggle
before Rob had been landed in the canoe. A disconsolate
silence fell on the little party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do now?&rdquo; wondered Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in pursuit of them as quick as possible, I
should think,&rdquo; opined Tubby.</p>
<p>The major shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much use in that,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;we would
not be likely to find them. No, the best plan is
to wait right here. If Rob escapes he will be
able to find his way back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they mean him harm?&rdquo; inquired
little Andy Bowles tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; responded the major,
&ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t dare to do much more than keep
him prisoner. But even that&rsquo;s bad enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what object can they have in all this except
to annoy us?&rdquo; asked the professor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Simple enough,&rdquo; said the major, rather bitterly,
&ldquo;I guess they are going to hold Rob as a
hostage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if they manage to keep him prisoner
we shan&rsquo;t see him again till I have given them
the plans to the location of the Dangerfield
treasure cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t dare&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the professor.
But the major interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already had a proof of what they
will dare,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are as desperate a band
of ruffians as I have ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Tubby, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll
bet,&rdquo; he added stoutly, &ldquo;that Rob will find a way
out of it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the canoes sped on through
the night. Rob mentally tried to keep some track
of the distance traversed, but he was totally unable
to do so. He judged, however, when the
paddles finally ceased their splashing, that they
must have come some distance, for it was day-break
when the canoes came to a halt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Rob was roughly jerked to his feet and then,
for the first time, became aware of Jumbo. For
his back had been toward the negro in the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah goodness, Marse Blake,&rdquo; exclaimed the
black, &ldquo;ain&rsquo; dis de mostes&rsquo; parallelxillus sintuation
dat you ever seen. Ah declar&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But further remarks on Jumbo&rsquo;s part were
roughly checked by the man who had paddled
the two prisoners to their present situation. He
was none other than the big-limbed rascal, Jim
Dale, who had played such a prominent part in
the theft of the pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your black head, nigger,&rdquo; he ordered
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ain&rsquo;t no niggah. Ah&rsquo;s a &rsquo;spectabilious
colored gent&rdquo;; protested Jumbo, &ldquo;&rsquo;nd I kain&rsquo;t
shut mah haid nohow &rsquo;cos it keeps openin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
shuttin&rsquo; of its own accord whar you busted me
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>But a fierce look from the man made even the
garrulous negro subside. As for Rob, he disdained
to talk to the fellow, or bandy words with
him. Instead, he gazed around while the other
canoes, filched from the Boy Scout camp, were
coming up. He noted that one was paddled by
Peter Bumpus, while the third one contained
Stonington Hunt and his son Freeman, the lad
who had already given the Boy Scouts so much
trouble.</p>
<p>It was a curious place in which the boy found
himself. But Rob, with his scout instinct, could
not but admire the skill with which it had been
chosen as a retreat.</p>
<p>The spot was like a large basin with steep rock
walls on all sides but one. On the open side a
narrow neck of the lake led into this natural fortress.
Great trees and luxurious water growth
masked the entrance and anybody, not knowing
of it, might have passed by it on the lake side
a hundred times without noting its presence. The
canoes had been paddled through this natural
screen of water maples and rank growth of all
kinds, which had closed like a curtain behind
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>A beach, narrow except at the far end of the
cove, ran round the water&rsquo;s edge at the foot of
the rocky walls. A small tent was pitched there,
and a fire was smoldering. Evidently the place
had been occupied for some little time as a camp.
Rob found himself wondering how the men, in
whose power he now was, had ever found the
place. He did not know then that Jim Dale and
Pete Bumpus had once been associated with a
gang of moonshiners, whose retreat this had been
before the officers of the revenue service broke
the gang up and scattered them far and wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Hunt had gleaned enough knowledge from the
plan, during his brief possession of it, to divine
which route the party would take to the hidden
treasure trove. He had, therefore, sought out
this place when Dale and Bumpus told him of it.
The boys&rsquo; enemies had made straight for it, and
had been encamped there some days awaiting the
arrival of the party. The notes of Andy Bowles&rsquo;
bugle floating out across the lake the night before
had apprised them of the arrival of the party,
and plans had immediately been made for a hasty
descent on the Boy Scouts&rsquo; mountain camp. How
successful it had proved we already know. But
of course, to Rob, all this was a mystery.</p>
<p>The canoes were grounded at the end of the
cove on the broad strip of beach. Rob and Jumbo
were at once ordered to get out, and Rob&rsquo;s leg-bonds
being loosened and gag removed, he followed
Jumbo on to the white sand. Hardly had
their feet touched it before Stonington Hunt and
his rascally young son, the latter with a sneer on
his face, also landed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell neatly into our little trap, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
jeered Stonington Hunt, staring straight at Rob
with an insolent look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; alls kin hev yo&rsquo; trap fo&rsquo; all I wants uv
it&rdquo;; snorted Jumbo indignantly, as Rob disdained
to answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, you black idiot!&rdquo; snapped Hunt,
&ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t want you, anyhow. I&rsquo;ve a good
mind,&rdquo; he went on with a brutal sort of humor,
&ldquo;to have you thrown into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By golly yo&rsquo; jes bring on de man to do it,&rdquo;
exclaimed the negro with great bravado, &ldquo;ah
reckon ah kin tackle him. Ah&rsquo;m frum Vahgeenyah,
ah is, an&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hunt impatiently checked him. He turned
to Peter Bumpus. &ldquo;Cook us up a meal,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For them, too?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, jerking his
thumb backward at Rob and Jumbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You may as well get used to it.
I expect they&rsquo;ll make quite a long stay with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s heart sank. He was a lad who always
schooled himself to look on the brightest side of
things. But no gleam of hope lightened the
gloom of their present situation. Things could
not have been much worse, he felt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">ROB FINDS A RAY OF HOPE.</span></h2>
<p>The meal, a sort of stew composed apparently
of rabbits, partridges and other small game, was
despatched and then Rob, who had been released
from his bonds while he ate, was tied up once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These fellows don&rsquo;t think much of breaking
the game laws,&rdquo; he thought as he ruminated on
the contents of the big iron pot from which their
noon-day meal had been served. Then came another
thought. If they so openly violated the
laws, the country was surely a lonely one, and
seldom, or never, visited. Indeed, the thick forest
of hemlock and other coniferous trees that
fringed the cliff summits, would seem to indicate
that the spot was well chosen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Jumbo was not confined. The gang seemed
to esteem him as more or less harmless for, although
a sharp watch was kept on him, he was
not fettered. Once or twice he caught Rob&rsquo;s eye
with a knowing look. But he said nothing. One
or another of the men kept too close and constant
a watch for that. And so the hours wore on.
Tied as Rob was, the small black flies and other
winged mountain pests made life almost intolerable.
With infinite pains the lad dragged himself
to a spot of shade under a stunted alder bush.
He lay here with something very like despair
clutching coldly at his heart. The canoes had
been anchored, with big stones attached to ropes,
at some distance out in the little bay. Only one
remained on shore, and by that Jim Dale kept an
unrelaxing vigil.</p>
<p>Jim and Peter were talking in low voices. Rob
overheard enough to know that their talk was of
the old lawless days when the moonshine gang
made the hidden cove their rendezvous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those were the days,&rdquo; Dale said with a regretful
sigh, &ldquo;money was plenty then. By the
way, Pete, did you ever hear what became of
Black Bart and the others after the revenues
broke us up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never wanted to take a chance of inquiring,&rdquo;
rejoined Peter, puffing at a dirty corn
cob. &ldquo;I did hear, though, that they had resumed
operations some place around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did, eh? I suppose they figgered that
lightning don&rsquo;t never strike twice in the same
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, they are taking a long chance.
With revenues against you it&rsquo;s all one sided&mdash;like
the handle of a jug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. But there&rsquo;s good money in it, and
Black Bart would risk a lot for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was carried on in low tones.
Rob, intent though he was, could not catch any
more of it. But he pondered over what he had
heard. If what Jim Dale and Peter had said
was correct, a gang of moonshiners still made the
mountains thereabouts their habitat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange situation we&rsquo;ve stumbled into,&rdquo;
thought the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Then he fell to observing Stonington Hunt and
his son, Freeman. The man and the boy were
talking earnestly at some distance from Peter
and Jim Dale. From their gestures and expressions
Rob made out that the conversation was an
important one. From the frequent glances which
they cast in his direction he also divined that he
himself, was, in all probability, the subject of it.</p>
<p>All at once Stonington Hunt arose and came
toward him. Freeman followed him. They
came straight up to Rob and stood over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Rob Blake,&rdquo; sneered young Hunt, &ldquo;I
guess things are different to what they were the
time you drove me out of Hampton and forced
my father to profess all sorts of reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; rejoined Rob coolly and contemptuously,
&ldquo;you seem to me to be very much
the same sort of a chap you were then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inference, and Rob&rsquo;s unshaken manner,
appeared to infuriate the youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you where we want you now,&rdquo; he
snarled, &ldquo;it would serve you right if I took all
the trouble you&rsquo;ve caused us out upon your hide.
You and that patrol of yours cost us our social
position, then that Hopkins kid lost our sloop for
us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sloop in which you meant to decamp with
the major&rsquo;s papers,&rdquo; put in Rob in the same calm
tones, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to assume any better position
than that of a common thief, Freeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick snarl of rage the boy jumped on
the helpless and bound boy. He brought his fist
down on Rob&rsquo;s face with all his force. Then he
fastened his hands in Rob&rsquo;s hair and tugged with
all his might. But suddenly something happened.
Something that startled young Hunt considerably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Rob gave a quick twist and despite his bonds
managed to half raise himself. In this position
he gave the other lad such a terrific &ldquo;butt&rdquo; that
Freeman was sent staggering backward, with a
white face. Unable to regain his balance he presently
fell flat on the sand. He scrambled to his
feet and seized a big bit of timber, the limb
of a hemlock that lay close at hand. He was advancing,
brandishing this with the intention of
annihilating Rob when Stonington Hunt, who
had hitherto been an impassive observer, stepped
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, here, what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he snapped angrily.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a fighting ring. Put down
that stick, Freeman, and you, young Blake, listen
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; said Rob, in the same cold, impassive
way that had so irritated Freeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to regain your freedom and rejoin
your friends, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; was the next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it can be done by honorable means&mdash;yes.
But I doubt if you can employ such, after what
I&rsquo;ve seen of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard words won&rsquo;t mend matters,&rdquo; rejoined
Hunt with a frown, &ldquo;after all, I&rsquo;ve as much
right to this hidden treasure as anyone else&mdash;if
I can get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you can get it,&rdquo; replied Rob with
meaning emphasis, wondering much what could
be coming next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your liberty depends on my getting it,&rdquo; resumed
Hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My liberty?&rdquo; echoed the boy, &ldquo;how is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to write a note to Major Dangerfield.
He thinks a good deal of you, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; responded Rob, mightily curious
to know what Hunt was driving at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s responsible, too, in a way, for your safety,
isn&rsquo;t he? I mean your parents rely on him
to bring you back safe and sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. But why don&rsquo;t you come to the
point. Tell me what it is you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this: You write to the major. I&rsquo;ll see
that the note is delivered. You must tell him to
give my messenger the plan and map of the treasure&rsquo;s
hiding place. If he does so you will be returned
safe and sound. So will the nigger and
the canoes. We didn&rsquo;t want that nigger anyhow.
In the darkness we mistook him for the major.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Rob could hardly repress a smile at the idea
of the dignified major being confused with the
ubiquitous Jumbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to write such a letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean am I willing to stake my safety
against the major&rsquo;s hopes of recovering his relative&rsquo;s
hidden fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s mind worked quickly. It might be dangerous
to give a direct negative and yet he certainly
would have refused to do as the rascal
opposite to him suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Can you give me time to think it
over?&rdquo; he hesitated, assuming uncertainty in decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll give you a reasonable period. But
mind, no shilly-shallying. Don&rsquo;t entertain any
idea of escape. You&rsquo;ll be guarded as closely here
as if you were in a stone-walled prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Rob, feeling an inward
conviction that Hunt&rsquo;s words were literally true.
The cliff-enclosed cove was indeed a prison.
Hunt turned away, followed by his son. The
latter cast a malevolent look back at Rob as he
went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My! His father must be proud of that lad,&rdquo;
thought Rob.</p>
<p>Hunt and his followers fell to playing cards.
Rob was left to his reflections. Jumbo sat gloomily
apart and yet in full view of the card players.
After a while Rob&rsquo;s thoughts reverted to the conversation
he had overheard between Dale and
Peter Bumpus. In this connection he suddenly
bethought himself of something. Jim Dale had
spoken of the revenue officers raiding the moonshiners&rsquo;
plant. If that was the case, and the miscreants
had all escaped, how did they go?</p>
<p>The revenue officers probably attacked the
place from the lake side of the cove. This would
have effectually shut off all hope of escape in
that direction. The only conclusion left, to account
for the freedom of the gang was a startling
one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>The cove must have some secret entrance or
exit. If such were the case it could only be by
a passage or by steps cut in the seemingly solid
rock. Rob&rsquo;s heart began to beat a bit faster.
There might be a chance of escape after all, if
only he could discover the means of exit he was
now certain must exist somewhere in the cove.</p>
<p>But a careful scrutiny failed to show any indications
of such a device as he was looking for.
The walls were bare and clean as cliffs of marble.
Not more than two or three stunted conifers
grew out of an occasional crevice. The enclosing
walls would not have afforded footing to a fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I was wrong,&rdquo; thought Rob to himself
and lying back on the sand he closed his eyes
the better to concentrate his thoughts. But what
with the strain of the early hours and the warm,
sultry atmosphere, the lad found his ideas wandering.
Presently, without knowing it, he had
dropped off into a sound slumber.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was with a start. The long
shadows showed him that the day was far spent.
All at once voices near at hand struck in upon
his half awakened senses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Rob heard a few words and then, with wildly
beating pulses, he fell to simulating sleep with
all his might. From what he had heard of the
conversation he believed that a hope of escape
lay in the words of the talkers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">A THRILLING ESCAPE.</span></h2>
<p>It was Peter Bumpus and Jim Dale who were
talking. From their first words Rob gathered
that Stonington Hunt and his son had gone fishing,
and that Jumbo, like himself, was asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure that kid is off good and sound,
too?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon find out,&rdquo; rejoined Bumpus.</p>
<p>Rob felt the man bend over him, his hot breath
fanning his ear. It was a hard job not to open
his eyes, but Rob came through with flying
colors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sound as a top,&rdquo; decided Pete, &ldquo;and old
Hunt and the kid won&rsquo;t be back for half an hour
anyway. Now&rsquo;s our time to see if the old rope
ladder is still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure did us a good turn the night the revenues
came,&rdquo; said Jim Dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, it was over this way, wasn&rsquo;t it?
Right under that big hemlock on the top of the
cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob heard them cross the sandy strip of beach.
Luckily, he was lying with his face toward that
side, and by half-opening his eyes could observe
their movements without danger of being discovered.</p>
<p>They approached a clump of bushes and
fumbled about in it for a brief time. Peter did
most of the searching, for that was what it
seemed to be, while Dale stood over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Dale at length, &ldquo;is it
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is what there?&rdquo; wondered Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here, all right,&rdquo; responded Peter Bumpus
and in triumph he held up something which only
by great straining of his eyes Rob was able to
recognize as a strand of wire. It was so slender
that if his attention had not been drawn to it
he would never have seen it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to give it a yank and bring the rope
ladder down,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a run in the old woods myself,&rdquo;
said Peter. He seemed half inclined to
pull the wire, which Rob judged, though he could
not distinguish it against the dull background of
rock, must lead to the cliff summit. On that cliff
summit the boy also assumed, from what he had
heard, there must lie a rope ladder. The mystery
of the escape of the rascals from the revenue officers
was solved. They had mounted by the rope
ladder on the first alarm and pulled it up after
them. Rob could hardly help admiring the strategy
that had conceived such a scheme.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while Peter Bumpus still hesitated,
there came the sharp &ldquo;splash&rdquo; of a paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the boss,&rdquo; warned Dale.</p>
<p>Instantly the two men strolled aimlessly across
the beach, as if their minds were vacant and idle.
Evidently then, Hunt was not aware of the existence
of the rope ladder, and the two men had
some strong object in wishing to hide it from
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The two Hunts brought back several fish,
perch and pickerel, which were cooked for supper.
After that meal the men sat about and
talked a while, and then preparations were made
for bed. Jumbo was tied hand and foot, much
as Rob was. But not content with these precautions,
Dale was stationed to watch the captives.
From what Rob could hear he was to be relieved
by Bumpus at midnight.</p>
<p>That Dale took his duty seriously was evident
by the fact that, beside him, as he crouched by
the fire, he laid out a ready cocked rifle, and kept
one eye always upon the two prisoners. To
amuse himself during his vigil he drew out a big
case knife and began whittling a bit of driftwood
into the likeness of a ship&mdash;a reminder of his
old seafaring days. Rob, watching the ruffian at
this innocent employment while the firelight
played on his rough features, caught himself
wondering what sort of childhood such a man
could have had, and how he came to drift into
his evil courses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that the Boy Scout movement in big
cities is keeping hundreds of lads out of mischief,&rdquo;
he thought, &ldquo;and helping to make good
men out of them. After all, or so dad says, most
bad boys are only bad because they have no outlet
but mischief for their high spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while, Dale finished his carving. Then
he darted a cautious look about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if any of that old moonshine is still
in the hiding place?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>For a while he remained still. Then he once
more cast a scrutinizing look around him. Rob
interpreted this as a meaning that Dale was anxious
to see if everything was quiet. The boy lay
still and silent and Dale evidently assumed he
was asleep. After a careful inspection of the
spot where the others slumbered, the fellow cautiously
made for the base of the cliff near the
clump of bushes where he and Bumpus had investigated
the wire that afternoon. Reaching
toward a stone he pulled it aside, and thrust his
arm into a recess which was suddenly revealed.
When he drew his hand out it clasped a demijohn.
The recess was the hiding place formerly
used by the moonshiners to conceal their product.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>With a swift glance about, to make sure he
was not observed, Dale raised the demijohn to
his lips. It stayed there a long time. He set it
down and looked about him furtively once more.
Then he raised the jug again and took another
long swig of the poisonous stuff. Rob, through
lowered lids, watched him with a shudder of disgust.</p>
<p>When Dale finally thrust back the jug into its
hiding place and returned to the firelight, his
step was unsteady and his eyes had a strange,
glassy light in them. He sank down on the log
which served him as a seat, and once more drew
out his knife. His intention, apparently, was to
resume his whittling. But after a few unsteady
strokes at the bit of wood he had selected, he
gave over the attempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>His head lolled limply forward and the corners
of his mouth drooped. One by one his fingers
relaxed their grip on the knife, and, resting his
head on his hands, he allowed himself to sink
into oblivion.</p>
<p>Instantly the Boy Scout&rsquo;s faculties were alert
and at work. The firelight played temptingly on
the knife the liquor-stupefied man had dropped.
Very cautiously the fettered Rob rolled over
upon his stomach and, slowly as a creeping snail,
began a tedious progress toward the weapon.
How he blessed the days he had spent practicing
such stealthy means of advance. It was the old
scouting crawl of the Indians he used. A means
of approach as silent as that of a marauding
weasel.</p>
<p>It was ticklish, scalp-tightening work, though.
But Rob did not dare to hurry it. The rattle of
a misplaced stone, the snap of a twig, might spoil
all. To add to the peril at any moment, either
the drowsy man by the fire, or one of the sleeping
men beyond, might awaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>But at last, without a single accident, Rob
reached the proximity of the precious knife. It
was a heavy weapon and lay on the rock-strewn
ground with its blade upward. The boy noted
this with a quick gulp of thankfulness. For, fettered
as he was, he could not have manipulated
it till he got his hands free.</p>
<p>With infinite caution he rolled his body so that
his wrists were close to the keen blade. Then he
began sawing at the ropes, rubbing them back
and forth against the blade. At length one of
the strands parted. Then another was severed,
and, with a strong jerk, Rob tore loose the rest.
Then, cautiously picking up the knife in his freed
hand, he slashed his leg-bonds. In less time than
it takes to tell it he was free.</p>
<p>His next task was to liberate Jumbo. And
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Rob had allowed his thoughts to dwell on the
daring possibility of recovering the canoes and
paddling away with them. But on second
thoughts he deemed this too risky. Instead he
determined to trust to the rope ladder. It had
flashed across his mind in this connection, that
the strands of the ladder might be too weak to
support his weight, or the much greater avoirdupois
of Jumbo. But the lad felt that they must
risk it.</p>
<p>Jumbo very nearly ruined everything. For, as
Rob bent over him, he awakened with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fo&rsquo; de lan&rsquo;s sake, massa, don&rsquo; you go to
confustigate dis yar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in a flash Rob had clapped his hand over
the garrulous black&rsquo;s capacious mouth. Jumbo&rsquo;s
first fear that his last hour had come was speedily
relieved as he saw who it was.</p>
<p>Rob, after a quick look about, assured himself
that Jumbo&rsquo;s words had not aroused any of the
sleepers. Then, taking his hand from the negro&rsquo;s
lips, he quickly slashed his bonds. In another
instant Jumbo, too, was at liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; you go fo&rsquo; ter do now, Marse Blake?&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Not a word. Follow me,&rdquo; breathed
the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis suttingly am a pawtuckitus state of affairs,&rdquo;
muttered the black, &ldquo;don&rsquo; see no mo&rsquo; how
we can git out uv this lilly place dan er fly kin
git out of a mo&rsquo;lasses bar&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he followed Rob, who, on tip-toe,
approached the clump of bushes where he knew
the wire he had observed that afternoon lay hidden.
With beating pulses he poked about in the
scrub-growth till, suddenly, his fingers encountered
the filament of metal. The most dangerous
step of their enterprise still lay before him. What
would happen when he pulled it? Would the
ladder come down with a crash that would
awaken their foes, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Rob lost no time in further indulging his nervous
thoughts, however. He gave the wire a good
hard tug. Simultaneously, from out of the blackness
above them, something came snaking down.
Rob dodged to avoid it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>He could have cried aloud with joy as, in the
faint glow cast by the fire, he saw that, right in
front of him were the lower rungs of a rope ladder.
It was padded at the bottom so that its descent,
abrupt as it had been, was almost noiseless.
Rob noted, too, with inward satisfaction, that the
ropes seemed strong and in good condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with you, Jumbo,&rdquo; he ordered in a tense,
low whisper.</p>
<p>The black turned almost gray with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah got ter clim&rsquo; dat lilly ladder lak Massa
Jacob in de Bibul?&rdquo; he whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob made an eloquent gesture toward the
camp of Hunt and his gang. The hint conveyed
proved effectual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah goodness, dis am suffin&rsquo; dis coon nebber
thought he hab to do,&rdquo; muttered Jumbo, &ldquo;but all
things comes to him who waits&mdash;so heah goes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>He set his foot on the ladder and, rapidly
ascending it, soon disappeared in the darkness
above. As soon as the slackness of the appliance
showed Rob that the negro was at the cliff summit,
the boy prepared to follow him.</p>
<p>But as he set his foot on the lower rung the
man by the fire awakened with a start. Before
Rob, climbing like a squirrel, could mount three
more steps he became aware that his prisoners
were missing.</p>
<p>Snatching up his rifle he ran straight toward
the rope ladder. The next instant Rob, with a
hasty glance backward, saw that the weapon was
aimed straight at him. His blood chilled as he
recollected having heard Dale that afternoon
boasting of his ability as &ldquo;a dead shot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">OUT OF THE FRYING PAN.</span></h2>
<p>For only an instant did Rob remain motionless.
Then, as if by instinct, he suddenly crouched. It
was well he did so. A bullet sang above his
head as he clung, swinging on his frail support,
and flattened itself with an angry &ldquo;ping!&rdquo;
against the rock wall above him.</p>
<p>The report brought the rest of the sleeping
camp to its feet. In an instant voices rang out
and hastily lighted lanterns flashed. Rob, taking
advantage of even such a brief diversion, sprang
upward. But with a roar of fury, Dale sprang
to the foot of the ladder. Desperation gave Rob
nimble feet. He literally leaped upward.</p>
<p>In his mind there was a dreadful fear. The
ladder was hardly strong enough to bear two.
By placing his weight on the lower part of it, it
was Dale&rsquo;s intention to bring him down to the
ground. That in such an event he could escape
with his life, seemed highly improbable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>But fast as he went, he felt the ladder quiver
as Dale&rsquo;s hold was laid upon it from below. At
this critical instant a sudden diversion occurred.
From right above Rob&rsquo;s head, or so it seemed, a
voice roared out through the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tak&rsquo; yo&rsquo; dirty paws off&rsquo;n dat ladder, white
man, or, by de powers, it&rsquo;s de las&rsquo; time you use
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Jumbo&rsquo;s voice. But Dale answered
with a roar of defiance. He shook the ladder
violently. Rob felt himself dashed with sickening
force against the cliff-face. But all at once there
was a warning shout. Something roared past his
ears, just missing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haids below!&rdquo; sung out Jumbo as he watched
the huge rock he had dislodged go crashing
downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>It missed Dale by the fraction of an inch. But
his narrow escape unnerved the fellow for an
instant. In that molecule of time Rob gained
the summit of the ladder, and Jumbo&rsquo;s strong
arms drew him up to safety beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, Jumbo,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dat wasn&rsquo; nuffin&rsquo;,&rdquo; modestly declared
Jumbo, &ldquo;if dat no-account trash hadn&rsquo;t uv leggo
I&rsquo;d have flattened him out flatter&rsquo;n dan a hoe
cake. Yas, sah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you would, Jumbo. But there&rsquo;s no
time to lose. Come, we must be getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One ting we do firs&rsquo; off wid alacrimoniousness,
Marse Blake,&rdquo; said Jumbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; len&rsquo; me dat lilly knife you take frum dat
pestiferous pussonage below an&rsquo; I shows yoh
right quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob had thrust the knife into his scout belt.
He now withdrew it and handed it to the negro.
With two swift slashes, Jumbo severed the top
strands of the ladder. A crash and outcry from
below followed. Rob, peeping over, saw that
Dale, who had just begun to mount after them,
was the victim. He was rolling over and over,
entangled in the strands of the ladder, while
Stonington Hunt stood over him in a perfect
frenzy of rage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now den, Marse Blake, ah reckin&rsquo; we done
cook de goose of dem criminoligous folks,&rdquo;
snorted Jumbo as he gazed. &ldquo;He! he! he! dey
is sure having a mos&rsquo; fustilaginal time down
dere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ll have plenty to think over for
a time,&rdquo; said Rob, rather grimly; &ldquo;come, let&rsquo;s
set out. Have you any idea in which direction
the camp lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sah. But I raickon if we des foiler de
lake we kain&rsquo;t go fur wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go toward the south, then. See,
there&rsquo;s the Scout&rsquo;s star, the north one. The
outer stars in the bucket of the dipper point to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish ah had a dippah full ob watah. I&rsquo;m
po&rsquo;ful thirsty,&rdquo; grunted Jumbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run across a stream before very long,
no doubt,&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>With these words the lad struck off through
the forest of juniper and hemlocks. The moon
had not yet risen, and it was dark and mysterious
under the heavy boughs. Jumbo held back a
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. What&rsquo;s the matter, Jumbo?&rdquo; exclaimed
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It look powerful spooky in dar, Marse Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess the spooks, if there are any,
will do us less harm than that gang behind us,&rdquo;
commented Rob.</p>
<p>Jumbo, without more words, followed him.
But he rolled his eyes from side to side in evident
alarm at every step. On and on they plunged,
making their way swiftly enough over the forest
floor. From time to time they stopped to listen.
But there was no sound of pursuit. In fact, Rob
did not expect any. With the ladder destroyed,
there was not much chance of the Hunt crowd
clambering over the cliff tops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>At such moments as they paused, Rob felt, to
the full, the deep impressiveness of the forest at
night. Above them the sombre spires of the
hemlocks showed steeple-like against the dark
sky. The night wind sent deep pulsations
through them, like the rumbling of the lower
notes of a church organ. All about lay the deeper
shadows of the recesses of the woods. They
were shrouded in a rampart of impenetrable
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;re keeping on the right track,&rdquo;
thought Rob, as it grew increasingly difficult, and
finally impossible, to see the north star through
the thick mass of foliage above them.</p>
<p>The boy knew the danger of wandering in
circles in the untracked waste of forest unless
they kept constantly in one direction. Without
the stars to guide him, it grew increasingly difficult
to be sure they were doing this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! Ah suttinly hopes we gits out of dis
foliaginous place befo&rsquo; long,&rdquo; breathed Jumbo
stentorously, stumbling along behind Rob over
the rough and stony ground that composed the
floor of the Adirondack forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>All at once, as Rob strode along, he stopped
short. Some peculiar instinct had caused him to
halt. Just why he knew not. But he was brought
up dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s de mattah, Marse Blake?&rdquo; quavered
Jumbo, &ldquo;yo&rsquo; all hain&rsquo;t seein&rsquo; any hants or conjo&rsquo;s,
be yoh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob replied with another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a match, Jumbo?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas sah, Marse Blake, I done got plenty ob
dem lilly lucilfers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dived in his pocket and produced a handful
of matches, which he handed to Rob. The
boy struck one, and, as the yellow flame glared
up, he uttered a little cry and stepped back with
a perceptible shrinking movement.</p>
<p>No wonder he did so. At the young Scout&rsquo;s
feet the flare of the match had revealed a yawning
abyss. One more step and he would have
been over it. Gazing into the ravine he could
hear the subdued roar of a stream somewhere
far, far below. A cold blast seemed to strike
upward against his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, what a narrow escape!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
Then, stirring a small stone with his
foot he dislodged it and sent it bounding over
the edge. Bump! bump! tinkle! tinkle! plop!
plop!&mdash;and then&mdash;silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, goodness, dat hole mus&rsquo; be as deep as
de bad place itself!&rdquo; exclaimed Jumbo, shrinking
back in affright, &ldquo;dat hole mus&rsquo; go clean frough
de middle of de world an&rsquo; come out de odder side
in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does seem as if it might,&rdquo; agreed
Rob; &ldquo;at any rate, if we&rsquo;d gone over it we&rsquo;d have
had no time to investigate&mdash;ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob gave a shudder he could not subdue as
he thought of their narrow escape.</p>
<p>The only thing to be done under the circumstances,
was to turn aside and keep on slowly,
awaiting the daylight to see where they were,
and the nature of their surroundings. They had
progressed in this fashion perhaps half a mile
or so, when Jumbo gave a sudden cry:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Marse Blake! Wha&rsquo; dat froo de trees
dere? Look uncommon lak a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a light. Although I don&rsquo;t know what
any habitation can be doing in this part of the
world,&rdquo; answered Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe even ef it&rsquo;s only er camp we kin git
suffin&rsquo; ter eat dar,&rdquo; suggested Jumbo hopefully,
&ldquo;ah&rsquo;m jes&rsquo; nacherally full ob nuttin&rsquo; but emptiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never make a Scout, Jumbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; belibe I wants ter be no Skrout nohow,&rdquo;
retorted Jumbo, &ldquo;dar&rsquo;s too much peregrinaciusness
about it ter suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob did not reply. But a moment later he
cautioned Jumbo to progress as cautiously as
possible. The boy could see now that the light
proceeded from the open doorway of a hut.
Within the rude structure he could make out a
masculine figure in rough hunting garb bending
over a stove at one end of the primitive place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>All of a sudden Rob&rsquo;s foot encountered something.
He tripped and fell, sprawling on his
face. At the same instant the sharp report of
a gun rang out close at hand.</p>
<p>The wire over which the boy had tripped, and
which was stretched across the pathway, had discharged
the alarm signal. As the echoes went
roaring and flapping through the forest, the man
who had been bending over the stove, straightened
as if a steel spring had suddenly sprung
erect.</p>
<p>He was a small, dwarfish-looking fellow, with
a clay-colored skin, beady, black eyes, shifty as
a wild beast&rsquo;s. The animal-like impression of his
face was heightened by a shaggy beard of black
that fell in unkempt fashion almost to his waist.
He wore blue jean trousers, moccasins and a
thick blue flannel shirt.</p>
<p>With a swift, panther-like movement, he
snatched up a rifle that stood in one corner of
the hut. His next move was to extinguish the
light with a sharp puff. Then, with every sense
wire-strung, he stood listening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">INTO THE FIRE!</span></h2>
<p>The moon had just risen. Her light silvered
the dark hemlock tops, and, by bad luck, fell in
a flood full upon Rob and Jumbo. The man who
had sprung into such sudden activity was, on
the contrary, completely shrouded in the black
shadow of the hut.</p>
<p>Even had they had weapons they would, situated
as they were, have been completely in his
power. To use a slang term, but one full of expressiveness,
he had &ldquo;the drop&rdquo; on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; rasped out the inmate of the
hut in a harsh, startled voice. &ldquo;Speak quick, for
I&rsquo;m right smart on the trigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are two wanderers who have lost our
way,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, &ldquo;we have no weapons and
have no wish to harm you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come forward a bit while I look you over,&rdquo;
said the man, his suspicion mollified a bit by
the boyish tone. But the next instant, as his eyes
fell on Rob&rsquo;s uniform, he seemed to bristle with
suspicion again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that uniform?&rdquo; he demanded; &ldquo;be you
some new-fangled revenue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Boy Scout,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, and then,
thinking it best not to relate his whole story at
once, he added, &ldquo;I got lost on a scouting expedition.
Our camp is not far from here on the other
side of the lake. All we want is some food, drink
and shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy Scout, eh?&rdquo; said the man, eyeing him
curiously, &ldquo;um, ay, I&rsquo;ve read of &rsquo;em. To my
mind you&rsquo;d be best at home instead of gallivanting
around the country and getting lost. But
who&rsquo;s that black fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rsquo;se a &rsquo;spectable colored gen&rsquo;ulman, suh,&rdquo;
began Jumbo indignantly in his usual formula.
But the black-bearded man checked him with a
gesture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a nigger, nigger, don&rsquo;t forget
that. I come from south of the Mason and
Dixon line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas, sah, yas, sah,&rdquo; grinned Jumbo. The big
black shivered and showed all the gleaming white
of his teeth and eyes in his alarm at the bearded
little man&rsquo;s fierce looks and gestures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I feed yer,&rdquo; was the bearded one&rsquo;s
next question, &ldquo;kin you pay? I&rsquo;m a poor woodsman
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can pay,&rdquo; Rob assured him. Foolishly
he drew out a rather well-filled purse. The
next moment he wished he hadn&rsquo;t. For a brief
instant the hut-dweller&rsquo;s keen, serpent-like black
eyes had kindled with an avaricious flame.</p>
<p>But he cleverly masked whatever emotion it
was that had swept over him at sight of the
money receptacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come on
in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Rather troubled in his mind, but deciding that
it was best to accept the situation as it unfolded,
Rob followed his conductor into the hut. Jumbo
ambled along behind, his black face expanded
in a grin of wonderment. The hut, within,
proved to be a roughly constructed affair of raw
logs. The chinks were plastered with clay,
mixed with grass to give it consistency. A few
skins hung on the walls and some rough, home-made
furniture stood about.</p>
<p>At one end of the place was a huge, open fireplace,
with a big hearthstone. It was not used,
however, the cookery being done upon the stove,
which also provided the heat.</p>
<p>At the end of the hut opposite to the chimney
a rough flight of steps led to an attic. After the
two half-famished wanderers had concluded a
hearty meal, washed down by strong, hot, black
coffee, their host motioned to the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef you want a shake-down you&rsquo;ll find straw
up thar,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Rob thanked him civilly and he and Jumbo
climbed the stairway and found themselves in a
low-ceiled loft. The floor was of unnailed
boards. Through the chinks between them the
ruddy lamplight below could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere&rsquo;s wusser beds in dis wale ob tears dan
nice clean straw,&rdquo; observed Jumbo philosophically
as he threw himself on his heap. Rob
agreed with him. The straw did, indeed, seem
soft and grateful after their recent hard knocks
and experiences. Following Jumbo&rsquo;s example,
the lad made for himself a kind of nest. Curling
up in it he was soon off in the deep, dreamless
slumber of healthy boyhood.</p>
<p>Voices awakened Rob. He sat up sharply.
They were coming from below. The sounds of
the conversation floated up through the wide
chinks in the rough floor.</p>
<p>Rob rolled on his side and peered through the
most convenient crack. Three men were now in
the room below him. As he gazed he was
amazed to see the hearthstone swing bodily backward,
on some concealed hinges, and a fourth
man emerge from some secret passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; said the newcomer, a huge figure of a
man with a big, blond viking-like beard, &ldquo;the
last keg is headed and fixed up. We&rsquo;ve finished
our work. To-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the black-bearded man checked him with
a sharp gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Sims,&rdquo; he warned, &ldquo;not so loud.
Go ahead, Watkins,&rdquo; he went on, turning to one
of the men with whom he had been talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I ses is,&rdquo; resumed this fellow, a squatty-built,
loosely-hung little fellow, with close-cropped
sandy hair, and a bristly growth on his
chin, like the stubble on an old tooth brush,
&ldquo;what I ses is, don&rsquo;t take no risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused impressively and then added in a
lowered voice, but one that reached Rob, nevertheless,
with thrilling clearness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Abraham Lincoln!&rdquo; gasped the boy,
&ldquo;this is a nice nest of hornets we&rsquo;ve stumbled
into. &lsquo;Fix &rsquo;em,&rsquo; that must mean us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the talk went on, and Rob strained his
ears for the continuation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if they was guvn&rsquo;ment men they wouldn&rsquo;t
hev walked in like they done, I reckon,&rdquo; put in
another man, a pallid, sickly-looking chap, with
pink-rimmed eyes and a ferrety, furtive manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best be on the safe side,&rdquo; counselled the
black-bearded man, who had introduced the travelers
to the hut, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got money, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money?&rdquo; questioned the blonde-bearded man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The boy has. And they haven&rsquo;t got
any weapons. I guess we&rsquo;ll have an easy time
of it with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That nigger looks pretty hefty, and the kid&rsquo;s
no weakling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the pink-eyed man who spoke. Rob felt
a shiver run through him. So they had been
observed while they were asleep and never knew
it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a fine Scout!&rdquo; thought the lad bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems kind of tough on the kid,&rdquo; said the
blonde-bearded man, &ldquo;but you never did have
no sense of pity, Black Bart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Black Bart! Rob&rsquo;s heart stood still and then
beat furiously. These men then, were the moonshiners
of whom Dale had spoken that afternoon.
It seemed, too, from their talk, that they suspected
him and Jumbo of being government spies.
In that case they would stop at nothing. And
they were four to one. The Boy Scout felt for
the knife he had filched from Dale, but in their
passage through the woods it must have been
lost, for he could not find it on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid or no kid,&rdquo; retorted Black Bart, viciously,
&ldquo;he can tell the revenues a story jes&rsquo; as well as
anybody else, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed the red-headed man, &ldquo;and
if they get us this time they&rsquo;ll make it hot for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This argument seemed to extinguish all regrets
in the blond-bearded man&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When air you goin&rsquo; ter do it?&rdquo; he asked. His
voice was perfectly matter-of-fact and cold-blooded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No time like the present. But it&rsquo;s best to get
&rsquo;em asleep. We don&rsquo;t want no noise,&rdquo; said Black
Bart, with deliberation. &ldquo;Pinky,&rdquo; to the pink-eyed
man, &ldquo;jes&rsquo; take a look upstairs and see if
they are asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob laid down and crouched still as a mouse
while he heard Pinky ascend the creaking stairs,
satisfy himself that the intended victims were
asleep, and retreat again.</p>
<p>Then the boy awakened Jumbo. In a few
words he apprised him of the situation. To
Rob&rsquo;s great relief, the negro, in this dire emergency,
seemed to be as self-possessed as he was
cowardly in minor matters. Many natures are
so constituted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we gwine ter do, Marse Rob?&rdquo; he
breathed, crawling noiselessly about on his straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a window over there,&rdquo; whispered
Rob; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to drop through it and chance
coming out safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawsy sakes! S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; it looks out on one ob
dem bottomless pitses lak yo&rsquo; all near fell inter
ter-night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped, it&rsquo;s the only way we can escape.
Hark! They&rsquo;re coming now. Get over to
the window with as little noise as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How &rsquo;bout you alls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow. You get it open first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word the negro noiselessly
wriggled across the floor to the window&mdash;a mere
opening in the wall&mdash;that Rob had observed. At
the same instant there came the &ldquo;creak! creak!&rdquo;
of the staircase as one of the men below began to
ascend the stairway.</p>
<p>There was a big bit of loose timber lying near
Rob&rsquo;s straw. With a sudden flash of anger at
the thought of the men&rsquo;s treachery, the lad
snatched it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shan&rsquo;t get off scot free, anyhow,&rdquo; he
decided within himself.</p>
<p>With the bulk of timber clutched in both his
hands, ready poised for a blow, Rob waited by
the opening at the head of the rickety stairway
as the midnight assailant ascended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;WE WANT YOU.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>A stubbly red-head protruded itself through
the opening. The crucial moment had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that!&rdquo; cried Rob bringing down the
bulk of timber with a resounding crack on the
fellow&rsquo;s pate. He grunted, clutched at the sill
of the opening for an instant, and then went
toppling down the stairway in a heap.</p>
<p>A roar of fury and a rush of feet from below
followed. But Rob did not wait for the sequel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope I haven&rsquo;t seriously injured the chap,&rdquo;
he thought, as he sprinted for the window, &ldquo;I
hit a bit harder than I meant to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the next instant, when red-head&rsquo;s voice
was added to the uproar below, Rob knew that
he had, at least, not impaired the miscreant&rsquo;s
talent for profanity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>All need of concealment was gone now. Rob&rsquo;s
heart leaped to the adventure. Jumbo was half
way through the window as the lad reached it.
Rob hastened him with a shove and a quick word.
The black held for an instant, clutching the sill,
and then he dropped. The next moment Rob
had followed him. He fell in a sprawling heap
on top of the black. Both were up in a jiffy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; gasped out Jumbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way&mdash;this!&rdquo; cried Rob, dashing across a
moonlit strip toward a dark belt of woods.</p>
<p>A fusillade of shots rang out behind them.
Rob heard the bullets screech as they spun by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law&rsquo;sy, Marse Rob, dem bullets talk ter me
mighty plain,&rdquo; gasped Jumbo as they gained the
comparative security of the dark hemlocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo; asked Rob, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey say Jum-bo, we&rsquo;se ah lookin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; you,
chile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Rob&rsquo;s reply might have been it was
forestalled the next instant by an entirely unsuspected
and startling happening. From the
woods <i>ahead</i> of them, came a sudden trampling
of feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Jumbo. Down in here!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Boy Scout, dragging the quaking negro down
into a clump of bushes. They were just in time.
The next moment half-a-dozen dark figures
rushed by them through the woods, going in the
direction of the hut they had just vacated so
summarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth does this mean?&rdquo; gasped Rob,
half aloud in his utter astonishment. Parting
the bushes a bit, he could perceive the dark outlines
of the hut and the newcomers deploying
across the moonlit strip in front of it.</p>
<p>A loud crash echoed through the sleeping
woods as the door of the hut was suddenly
slammed shut.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, the walls of the hut
and the space in front of it seemed to spit vicious
flashes of fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; cried Rob, excitedly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re attacking
the hut, Jumbo! What under the sun
does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said the negro, &ldquo;but mah hopes is
dat dey jes&rsquo; nachully exterminaccouminicate each
other like dem Killarney cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kilkenny cats, you mean, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all de same,&rdquo; retorted Jumbo, &ldquo;but say,
Marse Rob, we&rsquo;d bettah be clearing out ob here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s stay awhile. We&rsquo;re in no danger
here. In fact I&rsquo;ve an idea that this may all turn
out to be a good thing for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attacking party now dropped back a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re well armed and desperate,&rdquo; Rob
heard one of them say, &ldquo;better breathe a bit, boys,
and then we&rsquo;ll go for &rsquo;em again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a log and smash the door down,&rdquo;
said a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, O&rsquo;Malley,&rdquo; was the response,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s an old hemlock trunk. It&rsquo;s just the thing.
Lay hold, boys, and we&rsquo;ll smoke out that nest
of rats in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Willing hands laid hold of the big stick of
timber, and the next instant they were staggering
with it toward the hut. There was a low
word of command and a sudden dash. The log
was poised for an instant and then:</p>
<p>Smash! crash!</p>
<p>The massive door stood for a moment and then
toppled inward, falling with a splintering crash.
But a dead silence followed the fall of the door.
No more pretence of defense was made by the
inmates of the hut. Could they be going to give
up so tamely?</p>
<p>Then a sudden voice floated through the night.
The voice of one of the attacking party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! There&rsquo;s nobody here, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound them! Have they escaped us
again?&rdquo; came another voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&rsquo;s like it. Scatter and find them&mdash;back
for your lives, all of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warning cry was followed almost instantly
by a deafening explosion. A vivid flash of
blue flame occurred simultaneously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gollyation!&rdquo; gasped Jumbo, &ldquo;de end ob de
worl&rsquo; am comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole hut seemed to burst into flame at
once. Lurid, vivid fire seemed to gush from
every window and opening in the place. In color
it was an intense blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shades ob Massa George Wash basin!&rdquo; yelled
Jumbo, &ldquo;all de debils in dat pit we see back dar
is on de job! Come on, Marse Rob. Let&rsquo;s git
out ob here in double quick jig time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Rob sharply, &ldquo;I see it all,
now, Jumbo. That place was a moonshine joint&mdash;an
illegal distillery. Those men who just attacked
it are revenue officers. The explosion was
caused by hundreds of gallons of spirits. I guess
the moonshiners set it on fire to destroy the evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each instant the blaze rose higher. The hut,
within its four walls, was a mass of flames. It
glowed like a red hot furnace. Rob watched it
with fascinated eyes. The whole clearing was
bright as day. The dark woods beyond were
bathed in a blood-red glare from the flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The intense heat fairly blistered the trunks of
the nearest hemlocks. Resin ran from them
freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get further back, Jumbo, it&rsquo;s too hot
here,&rdquo; said Rob presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly goodness! It am dat,&rdquo; declared Jumbo
in awed tones, &ldquo;dat fire dere puts me in mo&rsquo; fear
ob dat bottomless pit dan all de preachifying I
ever listened to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But their retreat into the woods was checked
in a strange manner. Rob, who was in advance,
recoiled suddenly. A whole section of the woodland
floor seemed to uprear itself before his eyes,
and a wild figure, with a tangled black beard and
shifty, wicked eyes, emerged. Rob realized in a
flash that it was a trapdoor cleverly concealed by
brush and earth that had just opened. Simultaneously
he recognized the figure that was
crawling from it as that of Black Bart himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The man was too much perturbed to notice
their nearness to him. But suddenly his eyes fell
on them. With a furious oath he dashed at
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young fiend! You&rsquo;re responsible for
this!&rdquo; he yelled in a frenzy.</p>
<p>A knife glittered in his hand, but before he
could use it Jumbo&rsquo;s black fist collided with his
jaw. Black Bart fell sprawling back upon the
trap door which he had just opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon Jack Johnson himself couldn&rsquo;t hev
done no bettah!&rdquo; grinned the negro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t, sah!&rdquo; he exclaimed the next
instant as Black Bart struggled to rise; &ldquo;ah reckon
you can repose yo&rsquo;self right dar fo&rsquo; a peahriod
ob time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he pinioned the ruffian&rsquo;s arms to his
sides and held him thus.</p>
<p>As he did so, violent knockings began to resound
from under the trap-door. Evidently
somebody was imprisoned there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Let us out! Let us out!&rdquo; came sharp
cries from below, albeit they were considerably
muffled by the trap-door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; all come an&rsquo; sit on hyah too, Marse Rob,&rdquo;
urged Jumbo. &ldquo;Ah reckon den dey kain&rsquo;t git dat
door open till we am willing dat dey should conmerge
inter terrier firmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob guessed at once what had happened. The
moonshiners, following the attack of the revenue
officers, had realized that continued resistance
would be useless. They had, therefore, made
their escape by the secret passage, led into by
the swinging hearthstone. Its outlet evidently
being by the trap door on which they were then
stationed. But first, with wicked craft, they had
ignited their whole stock of spirituous liquors,
hoping in the consequent explosion, that the revenue
men would perish. This much seemed clear.
Indeed, it was confirmed afterward, and&mdash;but we
are anticipating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>The Boy Scout had just reached these conclusions
when a sudden stir in the brush behind him
made him look up. Two men stood there, the
light of the conflagration showing every detail of
their figures and countenances plainly. They
were regarding the group on the top of the trap-door
with peculiar interest.</p>
<p>Rob started up toward them but was abruptly
checked as two rifles were jerked to two shoulders,
and aimed straight at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move a step!&rdquo; warned one of the men,
&ldquo;I guess we want you.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">JUMBO EARNS $500.00&mdash;AND LOSES IT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you do want us, but not exactly in the
same sense as you mean,&rdquo; retorted Rob with a
chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, boy?&rdquo; asked one of the
men sharply, as several others of the revenue
officers&mdash;as Rob had guessed them to be&mdash;came
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that we&rsquo;ve got the whole gang you
were after bottled up in a tunnel under this trap
door,&rdquo; rejoined Rob breezily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas sah, Misto Arm-ob-de-Law,&rdquo; grinned
Jumbo, &ldquo;ah reckin no coon up a tree was eber
moh completely obfusticated dan dose same chill&rsquo;uns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; asked another of
the group, a gray-moustached man of stern appearance,
&ldquo;this boy is either one of the gang or
he has been reading dime novels.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nebber read a bit ob dat classification ob literachoor

&ldquo;ef yo&rsquo; alls don&rsquo; want dese men we got obfusticated
under hay&rsquo;ah, why we jes&rsquo; gits off dis yar
trap door an&rsquo; lits dem skeedaddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re sitting on, nigger?&rdquo; demanded
the gray moustached man, who seemed
to be in authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dis am a genelman what answers to
de ufoinious name ob Black Bart,&rdquo; grinned Jumbo
amiably, &ldquo;an&rsquo; ah&rsquo;s not a nigger, ah&rsquo;s a &rsquo;spectable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do be quiet, Jumbo,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, as the
inevitable protest came into evidence. &ldquo;The case
is just this, gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I am a
Boy Scout. This man is attached to our camp.
We wandered away and got lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob did not tell all that happened, for he foresaw
that such a procedure might lead to questions
which would bring out the fact of their
treasure hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you wear a Scout uniform now,&rdquo;
said the gray-moustached man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Boy Scouts don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; put in another
man, &ldquo;my sons are both in the organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What troop?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Curlews of Patchogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve met them in water games at
Patchogue,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, &ldquo;my name is Rob
Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine&rsquo;s Sam Taylor,&rdquo; said the man, advancing,
&ldquo;glad to meet you, Rob Blake, I&rsquo;ve
heard of you. This lad is all right,&rdquo; he said,
turning to the leader. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vouch for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; rejoined the gray-moustached
revenue officer, &ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t be too careful.
Well, Rob Blake, what&rsquo;s your story? Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I said, we lost our way,&rdquo; went on Rob.
&ldquo;We stumbled on that hut. We were tired and
faint, and for pay this man, on whom Jumbo is
sitting, took us in. I awoke in time to overhear
a plot to rob us. We escaped and while hiding
in the brush&mdash;not just knowing who you were,
friend or foe, we saw that trap-door open and
nailed that man&mdash;Black Bart. At least Jumbo
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it looks as if Jumbo gets five hundred
dollars reward for the capture of Black Bart, and
more may be in store. You say that the rest are
in that passage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you fellows tie Black Bart,&rdquo; ordered
the leader.</p>
<p>When this was done, the sullen prisoner not
uttering a word, the order to open the trap-door
was issued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No monkey tricks, you fellows,&rdquo; warned the
revenue officer, as it swung back, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take
stern measures with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one the occupants of the hut crawled
out and were promptly made prisoners. They
were almost exhausted, and could not have put
up a fight had they been so inclined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to get out,&rdquo; said the blonde-bearded man
as he submitted to being handcuffed, &ldquo;it was
hot enough in thar to roast potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you got scorched by the same fire you
intended should destroy us,&rdquo; said the chief revenue
officer dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he went on, turning to Rob, &ldquo;I
shall bring this bit of work to the attention of
the government. In the meantime, I may tell
you, that besides the five hundred dollars offered
for Black Bart&rsquo;s capture, there was a reward of
two thousand dollars for the apprehension of the
gang as a whole. I shall see that you and your
companion get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Rob, &ldquo;you had all
the trouble and risk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Marse Rob! don&rsquo; be talkin&rsquo; dat way.
Dey may take dat reward away ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; whispered
Jumbo, whose eyes had been rolling gleefully.
He could hardly credit his good fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re paid for our work,&rdquo; said the revenue
man briefly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that we always get
much credit for the risks we take. Half the
time they don&rsquo;t even mention our raids in the
papers. But we do our duty to Uncle Sam and
that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after, a search having been made of the
ruins of the hut, the revenue men set out with
their prisoners for the lake, where they had a
boat and two small bateaus. Rob and Jumbo accompanied
them. Jumbo walked like one in a
trance. He saw money fairly hanging to the
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with all that money, Jumbo?&rdquo;
asked Rob amusedly as they strode along.
Under the skilled leadership of the revenue men
the path to the lake was a simple matter to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah reckon&rsquo;s ah&rsquo;ll buy a &rsquo;mobile, Marse Rob,
an&rsquo; a pair ob patent lebber shoes&mdash;dem shiny
kind, an&rsquo; some yaller globes (gloves) an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s lef&rsquo; ober ah&rsquo;ll jes&rsquo; spend foolishly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you I&rsquo;d put some of it in a savings
bank,&rdquo; advised Rob, smiling at the black&rsquo;s enumeration
of his wants. &ldquo;You get interest there,
too, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; good dem safety banks, Marse Rob?
Dey calls dem safety but dey&rsquo;s plum dangerous.
Fus&rsquo; ting yo&rsquo; know dey bus&rsquo; up. Ah had a cousin
down south. Some colored men dey start a bank
down dere. Mah cousin he puts in five dollars
reposit. &rsquo;Bout a munf afterward he done go to
draw it out and what you think dat no-good
black-trash what run de bank tole him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure, Jumbo,&rdquo; answered
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dey said de interest jes&rsquo; nacherally done
eat dat fibe dollars up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Rob was still laughing over Jumbo&rsquo;s tragic
tale there came a sudden shout from ahead.</p>
<p>Then a pistol shot split the darkness. It was
followed by another and another. They proceeded
from the knot of revenue men who, with
their prisoners, were a short distance in advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gollyumptions! Wha&rsquo;s de mattah now?&rdquo; exclaimed
Jumbo, sprinting forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>A dark form flashed by him and vanished,
knocking Jumbo flat. Behind the fleeing form
came running the revenue men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Black Bart! He&rsquo;s escaped!&rdquo; cried one.</p>
<p>Rob joined the chase. But although they could
hear crashing of branches ahead, the pursuit had
to be given over after a while. In the woods
he knew so well the revenues were no match for
the wily Black Bart. With downcast faces they
returned to where the other prisoners, guarded
by two of the officers, had been left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have lost the whole boiling than
let Black Bart slip through my fingers,&rdquo; bemoaned
the leader, &ldquo;wonder how he did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how,&rdquo; struck in one of the officers,
holding up a strand of rope, &ldquo;he slipped through
the knots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves me right for taking chances with such
an old fox,&rdquo; muttered the leader, self-reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow we got the rest of them,&rdquo; said the
man who had recognized Rob, &ldquo;better luck next
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dere ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; ter be no next time,&rdquo; muttered
Jumbo disconsolately, &ldquo;dat five hundred
dollars and dat gas wagon I was a-gwine ter buy
hab taken de wings ob de mawning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lake was reached shortly before dawn.
True to their promise, the revenue men put Rob
and Jumbo ashore at the Boy Scouts&rsquo; camp. The
amazement and delight their arrival caused can
be better imagined than set down here. Anyhow,
for a long time nothing but confused fusillades
of questions and scattered answers could be
heard. Much hand-shaking, back-slapping and
shouting also ensued. It was a joyous reunion.
Only one thing marred it. The canoes were still
missing, and without them they could not proceed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE FOREST MONARCH.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s that up yonder&mdash;there, away toward
the head of the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby, standing on a rock by the rim of the
lake where he had just been performing his
morning&rsquo;s ablutions, pointed excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing but the wraiths of mist,&rdquo;
rejoined Merritt, who was beside him. The lads
were stripped to the waist. Their skin looked
pink and healthy in the early morning light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to consult an oculist,&rdquo; scornfully
rejoined Tubby, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got fine eyes for a
Boy Scout&mdash;not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you saw something,
actually?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You ought to know me better
than to think I was fooling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were they then&mdash;mud hens?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re a mud rooster. No, what I saw
looked to me uncommonly like our missing
canoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; half mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do say so,&mdash;and most emphatically, too,
as Professor Jorum says,&rdquo; rejoined the stout
youth, &ldquo;there they&rsquo;ve gone now. That morning
mist&rsquo;s swallowed &rsquo;em up just like I mean to swallow
breakfast directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would the canoes be doing drifting
about?&rdquo; objected Merritt. &ldquo;From Rob&rsquo;s story yesterday,
Hunt and his gang had them in that
cove. Do you suppose they&rsquo;d have let them get
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, willingly,&rdquo; rejoined Tubby sagely,
who, as our readers may have observed, was
a shrewd thinker, &ldquo;but it blew pretty hard last
night. The canoes may have broken loose from
their moorings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimminy! That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go and tell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t do anything of the kind,&rdquo; said
Tubby, half in and half out of his Boy Scout
shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if they did turn out to be mud hens
we&rsquo;d never hear the last of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;um that&rsquo;s so. What do you advise,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait till after breakfast. Then we&rsquo;ll
say we&rsquo;re going to take a tramp and sneak off
toward the head of the lake. If they are the
canoes they&rsquo;ll still be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have had a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt as a sudden idea
struck him, &ldquo;how do you propose to get them,
even if they do turn out to be the canoes. Stand
on the bank and call &lsquo;come, ducky! ducky!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby looked at his corporal with unmixed
scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can swim, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have every objection covered, like a
good Scout, Tubby. Well, we&rsquo;ll try after breakfast.
If they&rsquo;re not the canoes there&rsquo;s no harm
done, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except to our shoe leather,&rdquo; responded Tubby
finishing dressing.</p>
<p>The morning meal over, and Jumbo washing
the tin plates in silence&mdash;he was still regretting
that five hundred dollars&mdash;the two lads, in accordance
with their plan, got ready for their
tramp.</p>
<p>They buckled on their belts, saw that their
shoe-laces were stout and well laced, and
equipped themselves with two scout staves. It
was against the rules to carry firearms unless
the major or one of the leaders was along. No
objection was interposed to their going. In fact,
the major, worried as he was over the vanished
canoes, was rather glad to have an opportunity
for a quiet talk with the professor. Rob was
still rather fagged by his experiences of the preceding
night and day, and Hiram and Andy
Bowles had decided to indulge in signal practice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; called the major as the
young Scouts strode off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring back the canoes with you,&rdquo; mockingly
hailed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. We&rsquo;ll look in all the tree tops. I&rsquo;m
told they roost there with the gondolas,&rdquo; cried
the irrepressible Tubby, with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>The next instant the two adventurers had vanished
over the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what a laugh we&rsquo;ll have on them if we
really do bring the canoes back,&rdquo; chuckled Tubby
merrily, as they plodded along.</p>
<p>Distances in the mountains are deceptive.
From the camp it had not looked so very far to
the head of the lake. But the two lads found
that, what with the innumerable ridges they had
to cross, and the rough nature of the ground before
them, it was considerably more of a tramp
than they had bargained for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Of the canoes too, there was no sign. The
mists had now vanished and the sun beat down
on the smooth surface of the lake as if it had been
a polished mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve drifted ashore,&rdquo; said Tubby,
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they have I&rsquo;ll bet they chose the other one,&rdquo;
said Merritt, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s what they used to call at school
&lsquo;the perversity of inanimate things.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t spring any
more like that. I didn&rsquo;t bring a dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about noon when they came to a halt
in a ravine near the lake shore and sat down on
a log to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I wish we had something to eat,&rdquo;
groaned Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever hear of a fairy godmother?&rdquo; inquired
Tubby, gazing abstractedly up through the tree
tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you aren&rsquo;t the limit, Tubby. What
on earth have fairy godmothers to do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were always on the job with what was
most wanted, I believe,&rdquo; pursued Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk rot. Let&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash; Gee whiz!
I&rsquo;ll take it all back, Tubby. You are a real, genuine,
blown-in-the-glass fairy godmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt&rsquo;s exclamation was called forth by the
fact that Tubby had produced, with the air of a
necromancer, two packets of sandwiches and
ditto of cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s water in that spring, I guess,&rdquo; he
said laconically ignoring Merritt&rsquo;s open compliments.</p>
<p>The two lads munched away contentedly.
They were seated at the head of the little ravine
which ran back from the shore of the lake.
Above them towered a rocky cliff from which
flowed the spring. Ferns of a brilliant green
and almost tropical luxuriance festooned its
edges. The water made a musical tinkling
sound. It was a pleasant spot, and both boys
enjoyed it to the full. They would have appreciated
it more though, if they could have
stumbled across the canoes which Tubby was beginning
to believe were a figment of his imagination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if there were ever Indians through
here?&rdquo; said Merritt, after a period of thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so. They used to navigate most of
these lakes,&rdquo; said Tubby, stuffing some remaining
crumbs of cake into his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he added, staring at Merritt, with
puffed out cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking that if we were early
settlers and an Indian suddenly appeared in the
opening of this canyon or ravine or whatever
you like to call it, that we&rsquo;d be in a bad way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we couldn&rsquo;t get out. That&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo;
said Tubby, looking around, &ldquo;I guess the red
men would bury the hatchet&mdash;in our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad those days are gone,&rdquo; said Merritt,
&ldquo;I should think that the early settlers must have&mdash;Hark!
What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden crunching sound, as if someone was
leisurely approaching had struck on his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like somebody coming,&rdquo; rejoined
Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>His heart began to beat a little faster than
was comfortable. What if some of the Hunt
gang were prowling about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo; he asked, the next
moment, in rather a quavering tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiggered if I know,&rdquo; said Merritt; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go
toward the beach and investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better do that than stay here,&rdquo; agreed Tubby.</p>
<p>Picking up their scout staves both boys cautiously
tip-toed toward the mouth of the ravine.
But before they could reach it a sudden shadow
fell across the white strip of sand at the outlet.</p>
<p>The next moment a huge body came into view.
Its great bulk loomed up enormously to the eyes
of the excited boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big deer!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby; &ldquo;what a
beauty! Look at those horns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deer, a fine antlered beast that was moving
leisurely along the beach, looked up at the
same instant. It gazed straight at the boys for
a moment. Then it began pawing the ground
angrily, and tossing its head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can be the matter with it?&rdquo; said Merritt
in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bothered if I know,&rdquo; rejoined Tubby, &ldquo;it
looks kind of mad, doesn&rsquo;t it? Maybe we&rsquo;d better
try to climb up that cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; said Merritt, as the stag
buck lowered its head and its big eyes became
filled with an angry fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Tubby!&rdquo; he cried the next instant,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to charge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had he voiced the warning before, with
a furious half-bellow, half-snort, the buck rushed
at them at top speed, its antlers lowered menacingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">THE CANOES FOUND.</span></h2>
<p>Merritt made a spring up the side of the steep-walled
little ravine. He succeeded in grabbing
an outgrowing bush and drawing himself up to
a ledge about ten feet above the ground. Tubby
followed him. But the fat boy&rsquo;s weight proved
too much for the slender roots of the plant. It
ripped out of the cleft in which it grew, and
Tubby, with a frightened cry, went rolling over
and over down the steep acclivity. He fell right
in the path of the advancing stag. The creature
saw him and prepared to gore him with its horns.
But just as Tubby was giving himself up for
lost, an inspiration seized Merritt.</p>
<p>A big stone lay close at hand. He grabbed it
up and hurled it with all his might at the buck.
The lad&rsquo;s experience on the baseball diamond
stood him in good stead at this trying moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The rock, with all the power of Merritt&rsquo;s
healthy young muscles behind it, struck the buck
between the eyes. The animal staggered and
snorted. For one critical instant it hesitated, its
sharp forefeet almost on the recumbent fat boy.
Then, with a shrill sort of whinny of terror, it
swung, as swiftly and gracefully as a cat, and
clattered off, running at top speed.</p>
<p>Merritt lost no time in clambering down to
Tubby, who was sitting up and looking about
him in a comical dazed way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-h-h-has it gog-g-g-gone?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; laughed Merritt, &ldquo;it stood
not on the order of its going, but&mdash;got! as they
say in the classics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; remarked Tubby, getting
up slowly, &ldquo;I could almost feel those antlers investigating
my anatomy. Let&rsquo;s see how far he&rsquo;s
run.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>The two boys made for the entrance of the
ravine. Gaining it they had a good view up
and down the beach in either direction. On a
distant projection of rock stood the buck. He
was looking back. As he saw the boys he
wheeled abruptly and dashed into the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said Tubby shaking his head with
a serious air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s too bad?&rdquo; asked Merritt, struck by
the other&rsquo;s pensive air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if he&rsquo;d stood still a little longer and
we&rsquo;d had a gun we might have shot him,&rdquo; rejoined
Tubby with a perfectly serious face.</p>
<p>They turned, and as they did so a shout burst
from the lips of both.</p>
<p>Bobbing about serenely on the placid water,
not half a mile in the other direction, was the
red canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the others are ashore right there, too,&rdquo;
cried Tubby.</p>
<p>As he spoke the stout boy dashed off at surprising
speed for one of his build. It was all
Merritt could do to keep up with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>It was as Tubby had suspected. The blue
and the green canoes lay on the beach, their bows
just resting on the sand. The paddles were in
them and it was an easy task to embark and
capture the red craft. This was made fast to
the one Tubby paddled and the boys, congratulating
each other warmly, set out for the camp.
As they glided along Tubby uplifted his voice.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;R-o-o-w, brothers, row!</p>
<p class="t">The stream runs fast!</p>
<p class="t0">The rap&mdash;ids are ne-ar</p>
<p class="t">And the day&mdash;light&rsquo;s past.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ro-o-w&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t rowing, it&rsquo;s paddling,&rdquo; objected
Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever heard of a rhyme to paddling?&rdquo;
demanded Tubby, &ldquo;you might as well expect one
to motor boating,&rdquo; and he resumed his song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>As they drew near to the spot where the camp
had been pitched they saw the black figure of
Jumbo on the beach. Tubby hailed him in a
loud voice. Instantly the negro looked up, and
as his eyes fell on the canoes he tossed the frying
pan he was scouring high into the air. It descended
on his head again with a resounding
whack.</p>
<p>But that African head seemed hardly to feel
it. Bounding and snapping his fingers in joy,
Jumbo raced up to the camp, electrifying everybody
with the glad news that the canoes had
been found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth did you discover them, boys?&rdquo;
demanded the major, as the prows grated on
the beach and a glad rush of excited feet followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple,&rdquo; said Tubby, with a grand air and
a sweep of his hands, &ldquo;simple. They were up in a
tree, just as I suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before long Merritt had to tell the real
story. But when they looked about for Tubby
to congratulate him that modest youth had
slipped away. He was found later, devouring a
raisin pie of Jumbo&rsquo;s baking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You deserve pie and anything else you fancy,&rdquo;
said the major warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing I&rsquo;d fancy right now,&rdquo;
rejoined Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have hold of Freeman Hunt for
about ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An examination of the canoes showed that, as
Tubby had guessed, their mooring ropes had
chafed through during the wind storm of the
night before. This set them wondering how
Hunt and his companions could have escaped
from the cove. The next day on resuming their
journey they examined the place&mdash;the entrance
to which was not found without difficulty&mdash;but
of Hunt and his gang no trace was found but
the embers of the camp fire. Rob and Jumbo
viewed with interest the rope ladder which lay
in a heap at the foot of the cliff, just as it had
fallen on the night that they made their escape.
Further investigation showed that, by walking
along the lake shore, the rascals who had
harried the Boy Scouts must have managed to
find a place to climb up to the forests above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they got away,&rdquo; said Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we all, I expect,&rdquo; said the professor.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we shall ever see them again
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; agreed the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere&rsquo;s only one man ah&rsquo;d lak ter see ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo;
put in Jumbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; inquired Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat five hundred dollah baby wid de black
whiskers,&rdquo; was the prompt rejoinder; &ldquo;de nex&rsquo;
time ah gits mah han&rsquo;s on him ah&rsquo;m gwine ter
fin&rsquo; de bigges&rsquo; chain ah can, den ah&rsquo;m gwine ter
fasten dat to de bigges&rsquo; rock ah kin fin&rsquo; an&rsquo; den
ah&rsquo;s gwine ter k&rsquo;lect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope for your sake and for that of law and
order that you succeed,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;liquor
is vile stuff, anyhow. It&rsquo;s bad enough that it is
made legally in this country. It is ten thousand
times worse when laws are broken to distil it.
I&rsquo;m afraid, however, that all the rascals have
slipped through our fingers. We shall hardly
set eyes on them again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>How wrong the major was in this supposition
we shall see before long. Such men as Stonington
Hunt and his chosen companions are not so
easily thrown off the trail for a rich prize. The
thought of the treasure was in Hunt&rsquo;s avaricious
mind day and night, and already he was plotting
fresh means of wresting the secret from its
rightful possessors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Possibly, if the major had seen an encounter
which took place in the woods not so many hours
before our party landed in the hidden cove, he
might have felt less easy in his mind. Black
Bart, in his flight, had encountered Hunt&rsquo;s party.
Creeping through the woods he had seen the
light of their camp fire. He had approached it
cautiously. But as he neared it, keeping in careful
concealment, he recognized his erstwhile comrades,
Dale and Pete Bumpus. Hesitating no
longer to declare himself in his half-famished
condition, he had come forward and been greeted
warmly. What he had to tell of his meeting
with Rob and Jumbo, held, as may be imagined,
the deepest interest for Hunt and the others.
The consultation and plan of campaign that resulted
therefrom, were fraught with important
results for our party.</p>
<p>What these were we must save for the telling
in future chapters. But stirring events were
about to overtake the Boy Scouts and their
friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;THE RUBY GLOW.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Camp, that night, was made at the portage of
which the major had spoken. Although strict
watch was kept all night nothing unusual occurred.
Bright and early the work of the portage
was commenced. The Major, Jumbo and Professor
Jorum, each burdened themselves with a
canoe, which they carried across their shoulders,
turned bottom up and resting on a wooden
&ldquo;yoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lads carried the &ldquo;duffle&rdquo; and provisions.
The portage, connecting the lake they had traversed
with the one beyond, was over rough
ground. In fact, at one place, they had to clamber
up quite a ridge. It was rocky and grown
with coarse undergrowth interspersed with scanty
trees. Further on the trail ran beside quite a
deep ravine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Tubby, with his load of duffle, was slightly in
advance of the other lads, and humming a song
as he trudged along. With the curiosity natural
to the stout youth, he could not refrain from
wandering from the path to peer over into the
depths of the gulch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; he exclaimed to himself, as
he gazed interestedly, &ldquo;it would be no joke to
fall in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he drew closer to the edge of the
rift and craned his short neck to obtain a still
better view of the abyss below him. At this
juncture the others, laboring along the trail,
caught up with him, and Rob gave the stout
Scout a hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better come away from there, Tubby,&rdquo; he
warned, &ldquo;you know what happened out west,
when you went rubbering about the haunted
caves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; retorted the fat boy, &ldquo;it looks
nice and cool down in there. I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>The rest of his speech was lost in an alarmed
exclamation from the onlookers.</p>
<p>As Tubby uttered his confident remark he
seemed to vanish suddenly, like an actor in a
stage spectacle who has dived through a trap
door. Only a cloud of dust and a roar of stones
sliding into the ravine told of what had happened
to the over-confident youth. Standing too close
to the edge he had stepped on an overhanging
bit of ground and had been precipitated downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Rob, in real alarm,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a swift fear that Tubby&rsquo;s accident might
have resulted fatally, Rob was at the edge of
the ravine in two jumps. The rest were not far
behind him.</p>
<p>Rob experienced a feeling of intense relief,
however, as he gazed into the depths. Some
time before, a tree had become dislodged and
slid into the rift. It lay upon the bottom of the
place. Tubby, luckily for himself, had fallen
into its branches and was, except for a few
scratches, apparently unhurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you injured?&rdquo; demanded Rob, anxiously,
nevertheless. He wanted to hear from Tubby&rsquo;s
own lips that he was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing hurt but my feelings,&rdquo; the stout
youth assured him. &ldquo;Say, it <i>is</i> cool down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if nothing&rsquo;s hurt but your feelings
you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; cried Merritt; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t
hurt those with an axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you wait till I get out of here,&rdquo; yelled
Tubby from his leafy seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how are we going to get you up?&rdquo; demanded
Merritt. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to stay
there till we get a ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take
the ropes off the packs and join them together.
Then we can knot one end to one of the staves
and haul Tubby up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; called the stout youth,
who had overheard, &ldquo;and hurry up, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, it needs an elephant to haul your
fat carcass out of there,&rdquo; scoffed Merritt. &ldquo;I
guess we&rsquo;ll take our time over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take as long as you like, so long as you get
me out,&rdquo; parried Tubby, &ldquo;you always were slow,
anyhow, as the fellow said when he threw his
dollar watch into the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take long to rig up an extemporized
life-line with the pack ropes. This done, one
end was made fast to the staves, and the other
lowered to Tubby. At Rob&rsquo;s orders the rope
was passed round a tree trunk, and when Tubby
had adjusted the rope under his arm pits the
young Scouts began to haul. As Merritt had
said, Tubby was no lightweight. Once they had
to stop, and the rope ran back quite a way. A
yell from Tubby ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Keep on hauling there!&rdquo; he roared,
&ldquo;what do you think I am, a sack of potatoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel like a sack of sash weights!&rdquo; shouted
Rob, &ldquo;keep still now, and we&rsquo;ll have you out in
a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>A few minutes later Tubby&rsquo;s fat face, very
red, appeared above the edge of the rift over
which he had taken his abrupt plunge. Rob
seized him by the shoulders and dragged him
into safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, for goodness sake don&rsquo;t fall in
again,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you aren&rsquo;t always telling me to fall in,&rdquo;
scoffed Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time we drill,&rdquo; said the stout youth
solemnly, flicking some dust off his uniform with
elaborate care.</p>
<p>Owing to the length of time occupied by extricating
Tubby from his difficulties, the canoe bearers
had become apprehensive of harm to the following
body and had halted. Of course questions
ensued when the rear guard came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; demanded the major, noting
the suppressed amusement on the lads&rsquo; faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tubby fell in again,&rdquo; answered Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell in?&rdquo; asked the professor in an astonished
tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I went hunting for botanical specimens at
the bottom of a ravine, professor,&rdquo; said Tubby
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For botanical specimens? Most interesting.
Pray did you find any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a Bumpibus Immenseibus,&rdquo; replied
Tubby with perfect gravity. The other
boys had to turn aside and stuff their fists in
their mouths to keep from laughing outright.</p>
<p>Even the major&rsquo;s lip quivered. But the professor
displayed immense interest. As for Jumbo,
he was lost in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat suttinly am de mos&rsquo; persuasive word
I&rsquo;ve done hearn in a long time,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Blumpibusibus Commenceibus. What am dat,
fish, flesh or des corned beef?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pain,&rdquo; rejoined Tubby, &ldquo;and usually
follows a fall. But not a fall in temperature,
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Hopkins, I fear you are making merry
at my expense,&rdquo; exclaimed the professor, good-naturedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I took a tumble, anyhow,&rdquo; said Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About time you did,&rdquo; came in Merritt&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>In the chase that ensued a wave of merriment
burst loose. But time pressed, and the march
was speedily resumed, with but a short interruption
for lunch.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon they emerged on the shores
of the other lake. It was a beautiful sheet of
water, narrow and hemmed in by high hills
which shot up abruptly on every side. At the
far end could be seen a series of three peaks,
jagged and sharp against the sky. The major
turned to the professor, and both consulted the
map and the translation of the cipher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the ruby mound masks the Three
Brothers take a course by the great dead pine.
Four hundred to the west, three hundred to the
north, and below the man of stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the words which the major read
aloud from the professor&rsquo;s translation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you interpret that, professor?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, plainly enough: the three brothers referred
to are those three similar peaks,&rdquo; said the
professor; &ldquo;the map indicates them. The ruby
mound is not quite so clear. But I don&rsquo;t doubt
that we shall stumble across its meaning, and
also that of &lsquo;the man of stone,&rsquo; which, I confess,
I cannot make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be it&rsquo;s some mass of rock that looks like
a man,&rdquo; volunteered Rob, who, like the others,
had listened with eager attention while the major
read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea, my boy. That is possibly
the correct meaning, although the old buccaneer
may have spoken in riddles. Such men frequently
did. However, we are at the gateway
of our venture. To-morrow we shall know if
it meets with success or failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; echoed the Boy Scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ef ah could cotch dat five-hundred-dollah-pusson
to-morrow dat would be all de treasure
ah&rsquo;d want,&rdquo; mumbled Jumbo as he set down his
canoe. He had kept it on his back up to now,
like a shell on a black turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah don&rsquo; lak dis business ob interfussin&rsquo; wid
a dead man&rsquo;s belongin&rsquo;s. No good ain&rsquo;t gwine
ter come uv it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you mumbling about, Jumbo?&rdquo;
asked the major, overhearing some of this last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, majah, I was jes&rsquo; a communicatin&rsquo; to
myself mah pussonal convictions on de subjec&rsquo;
ob dead men&rsquo;s gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jumbo, are you superstitious?&rdquo; inquired
the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sah. Ah&rsquo;s bin vaccinated an&rsquo; am glad
to say it <i>took</i>. We ain&rsquo;t neber had no supposishishness
in our fam&rsquo;bly. But dis yar meddlin&rsquo;
an monkeyin&rsquo; wid what belongs to dem as is daid
and buried is bad bis&rsquo;nis, sah&mdash;bad bis&rsquo;nis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that you had more courage than
that,&rdquo; said the professor seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah got lots ob dat commodity, too, sah. Ah
dassay dat ah is de bravest man in de&mdash;Oh! fo&rsquo;
de law&rsquo;s sake, wha&rsquo; dat? Oh, golly umptions!
Majah! You Boy Scrouts, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumbo suddenly cast himself down on the
ground and began rolling over and over, trying
to seize the major&rsquo;s feet in his paroxysm of real
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; ordered the major curtly, &ldquo;get up
at once, you cowardly creature. What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mah goodness, majah, you didn&rsquo;t see it.
You had yo&rsquo; back to der bushes. So did de
odders. But ah seed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw what, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, golly gumptions! De ugliest lilly face
wid black whiskers an&rsquo; eyes dat I ebber seed. It
was lookin&rsquo; frough de bushes an&rsquo; listening to you
alls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Show me the place at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major&rsquo;s tone was curt and fraught with
a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right hyah, sah, majah. Right hyah, dis
am whar I seen dat homely lilly face. Yas sah.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>But although they made a thorough search of
the vicinity no trace of a concealed listener could
be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be half-inclined to put it down to Jumbo&rsquo;s
foolishness if it wasn&rsquo;t that we know we have
enemies in the mountains,&rdquo; said the major, after
supper that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as it is, sir?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is,&rdquo; replied the major, &ldquo;I think we had
better keep a sharp look out and &lsquo;Be Prepared.&rsquo;
Jumbo&rsquo;s description of that face seems to tally
pretty closely with the countenance of Black
Bart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I think,&rdquo; rejoined Rob; &ldquo;if he
hadn&rsquo;t got so frightened Jumbo might have secured
that five hundred dollars after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marse Rob,&rdquo; said Jumbo, who had been listening
intently, &ldquo;you ebber hyah dat lilly story
&rsquo;bout de man wot caught de wild cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; heave ahead with the yarn, Jumbo,&rdquo; said
the major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sah, onct upon a time two men was
campin&rsquo;. One went to der spring ter git watah.
Pretty soon de one lef&rsquo; behin&rsquo; hearn de awfullest
racket and caterwaulin&rsquo; by dat spring you ever
hearn tell ob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What de mattah?&rsquo; he call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I got a wild cat!&rsquo; holler de man by de spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kain&rsquo;t you hole him?&rsquo; hollers his fren&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I kin hole him all right,&rsquo; hollered de udder
feller, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t know how ter let him go
ag&rsquo;in&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the laughter excited by this narration
had subsided, Jumbo rolled his eyes solemnly
and cleared his throat. Then he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; dat lilly nanny-goat (anecdote) applies
sah, dat applies ter me and dis yar Black Bart
or whateber his name am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">THE BUCCANEER&rsquo;S CAVE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The three peaks are in line, but no trace of
the &lsquo;ruby glow&rsquo; the cipher speaks of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was Rob Blake. He and Merritt,
in the red canoe, were in advance of the other
craft. The first level rays of the early sun were
slanting down over the precipitous hills surrounding
the lake and gilding the placid sheet
of water with a glittering effulgence. The
canoes seemed to hang on the clear water as if
suspended.</p>
<p>Right ahead of the adventurers, the three
jagged peaks seen the previous evening had
gradually swung into line, until the first and
nearest one veiled the other two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run the canoe ashore. May be we shall
come across something to make the meaning of
the cipher plainer,&rdquo; suggested Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Presently the bow of the canoe grazed the
beach, and the two active young uniformed figures
sprang out. For an instant they looked
about them. Then suddenly Merritt gripped
Rob&rsquo;s arm with such a tight pressure that it
actually pained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob followed the direction of Merritt&rsquo;s gaze
and was tempted to echo his cry. Through the
trees a rectangular mound of rock, with a dome-like
summit, had just caught the rays of the
sun.</p>
<p>In the early morning light it glittered as redly
as if bathed in blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruby glow!&rdquo; breathed Rob poetically,
gazing at the wonderful sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be some sort of mica or crystal in the
rock that catches the sunlight,&rdquo; said the practical
Merritt; &ldquo;good thing we didn&rsquo;t come here on a
dull, cloudy day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; rejoined Rob; &ldquo;we might easily
have missed it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the others!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt.
&ldquo;See, the ruby glow is masking the Three
Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Rob, &ldquo;this is the place, beyond
a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the other canoes had been beached
and their occupants were presently gazing in
wrapt wonder at the spectacle. As the sun rose
higher they could see the glow diminishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ancestor chose his hiding place well,&rdquo;
said the professor to Major Dangerfield, &ldquo;only
at sunrise and at sunset can the glow be visible.
At any other hour of the day there would be
nothing unusual about that rock but its shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Tubby broke into song. He caught
at the others&rsquo; hands. In a jiffy the Boy Scouts
were dancing round in a joyous circle, singing
at the top of their lungs:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ruby glow! ruby glow!</p>
<p class="t">We have sought you long, you know!</p>
<p class="t0">Now you&rsquo;re found we won&rsquo;t let go</p>
<p class="t">Till we get the treasure&mdash;ruby glow!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rather anticipating, aren&rsquo;t you, boys?&rdquo; asked
the major, &ldquo;there is still quite a lot to be done
before we discover the cavern where the treasure
is supposed to be buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But despite his calm words they could see that
the major was quite as much excited as themselves
at the idea of being on the threshold of
great discoveries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we press forward,&rdquo; suggested the
professor presently; &ldquo;I think that the base of the
ruby mound is the place to start from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoes were hauled up on the beach and
concealed in a high growth of tangled water
plants. They did not wish to risk having them
stolen for a second time. Then they struck forward
into the gloom of the woods lying between
the ruby mound and the lake. As they went the
Boy Scouts hummed Tubby&rsquo;s little song. Even
Jumbo seemed to have cast off his gloom. His
great eyes rolled with anticipation as they pressed
on, ambition to find the treasure cavern lending
wings to their feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Before long they were at the base of the ruby
mound. It was quite bare, and rose up almost
as if it had been artificially formed. The professor
declared it to have been of glacial origin.
Certain markings on it he interpreted as being
Indian in design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to indicate that at one time the
Indians, who formerly roamed these mountains,
used this mound as a watch tower,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
must have made a good one, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too high colored for me,&rdquo; said Tubby in an
undertone.</p>
<p>But by this time the glow had fled from the
conical-shaped top of the mound. It was a dull
gray color now, and, except for its shape and
barrenness, looked just like any other rock pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the dead pine!&rdquo; cried Hiram suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; exclaimed the major, as his gaze
fell on an immense blasted trunk soaring above
the rest of the trees, &ldquo;boys, we are hot on the
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks so,&rdquo; agreed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; exclaimed the professor, as they
stood at the base of the pine, which appeared to
have been blasted by lightning at some remote
period, &ldquo;now then, one of you boys pace off four
hundred feet to the west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob drew out his pocket compass and speedily
paced off the distance. This brought them into
a sort of clearing. It was small, and circular in
shape, and dense growth hedged it in on all sides.
By this time the boys were fairly quivering with
excitement, and their elders were not much behind
them in eager anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, three hundred to the north,&rdquo; ordered
the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to plunge right into the brush,&rdquo;
said Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Go ahead. In a few minutes now
we shall know if we&rsquo;re on a fool&rsquo;s errand or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former army officer&rsquo;s voice was vibrant
with emotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Followed by the others, Rob pushed into the
brush, pacing off the required three hundred feet
as accurately as he could. All at once he came
to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>As they looked about them a feeling of keen
disappointment set in. Tall brush was hemming
them in on all sides. No trace of a stone man,
or anything else but the close-growing vegetation,
could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fooled again!&rdquo; was the exclamation that was
forcing itself to Tubby&rsquo;s irrepressible lips when
he stopped short, struck by the look of keen disappointment
on the major&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we had had all our trouble for
nothing, boys,&rdquo; he began, when Rob interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that off there, major, through the
bushes yonder. You can see it best from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major hastened to the young leader&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of cliff or precipice,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the man of stone is located there,&rdquo;
suggested Rob; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth trying, don&rsquo;t you
think so, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means. This growth may have sprung
up since the treasure was hidden away, and so
have concealed the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the party moved on. A few paces
through the undergrowth brought them to the
foot of a steepish cliff of rough, gray stone. It
appeared to be about thirty feet or more in
height. Above it towered the rugged peak of
the first of the Three Brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;s the man of stone?&rdquo; asked the
professor in a puzzled tone, gazing about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s certainly no indication of a man of
that material or any other,&rdquo; opined the major,
likewise peering in every direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mass of rock on the cliff top?&rdquo;
asked Merritt suddenly; &ldquo;it looks something like
a human figure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>They all gazed up. A big mass of rock was
poised at the summit of the cliff. There was a
large rock with a smaller one perched on the
top of it. To a vivid imagination it might have
suggested a body and a head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth investigating, anyway,&rdquo; decided
the major; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll look at the face of the cliff directly
beneath it. Maybe there is an opening
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this decision was more easily arrived at
than carried out. Thorny brush and thick, tall
weeds shrouded the base of the cliff for a height
of eight or ten feet. But the Boy Scouts had
their field axes with them, and before long the
blows of the steel were resounding. In a few
minutes they had cleared away a lot of the brush
directly beneath the two poised stones.</p>
<p>The major and the professor, with Jumbo looking
rather awe-stricken at the major&rsquo;s side, stood
watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These balanced stones prove my theory that
all this is of glacial origin,&rdquo; the professor was
saying. &ldquo;Some antediluvian water course must
have left them there. Why, it wouldn&rsquo;t take
much of a push to shove them over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; agreed the major; &ldquo;in that case,
supposing that an entrance does exist at this
spot, they would block it effectually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much so,&rdquo; agreed the professor dryly;
&ldquo;in fact&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo-r-a-y!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shout rang gladly through the silent
woods. The boys had thrown down their axes
and stood with flushed, triumphant faces turned
toward the elder members of the party. The
major was quick to guess the cause of their excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; he cried, springing forward.</p>
<p>The professor and Jumbo followed. As they
came up Rob was pointing to an opening at the
base of the cliff which the cleared brush had
revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entrance to the cavern of Ruby Glow!&rdquo;
he exclaimed dramatically, while the rest of the
Boy Scouts swung off into Tubby&rsquo;s extemporized
song of triumph.</p>

<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">TRAPPED IN A LIVING TOMB.</span></h2>
<p>After the first excitement and confusion had
quieted down a bit, the major and the professor
began discussing ways and means for exploring
the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we start?&rdquo; asked Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, I think,&rdquo; said the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said the professor; &ldquo;no
time like the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being the case,&rdquo; declared the major with
a smile, &ldquo;Jumbo had better set out for the canoes
at once, and bring some provisions and the lanterns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lanterns referred to were of the variety
used by miners, which had been brought along
for the special purpose in which they were now
to be employed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>But Jumbo was not allowed to set off alone on
his expedition. The eager Boy Scouts raced off
with him. They soon returned with a supply of
canned goods, plenty of matches and some firearms
and the lanterns. The latter were quickly
lighted and, each member of the party shouldering
a burden, the dash into the cave was begun.</p>
<p>It was a creepy, mysterious sensation. The
light seemed to go out with a sudden snap as
they passed the portals of the cave entrance.
Only the yellow light of the lanterns, pale after
the bright sunshine, illumined the damp walls.
A queer, dead, musty smell was in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better proceed carefully,&rdquo; said the professor;
&ldquo;we may encounter a pocket of poisonous
air before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were looking for a pocket full
of money,&rdquo; whispered Tubby to Merritt, behind
whom he was pacing.</p>
<p>The party had to advance in single file, for
beyond the entrance of the cave was a narrow
passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how your ancestor ever located this
place?&rdquo; said Rob, wonderingly, as they proceeded
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family legend has it that he came in here
in pursuit of a wounded wild animal he had shot,
and which sought refuge here,&rdquo; said the major.</p>
<p>It was a strange, rather uncanny feeling to be
treading the long unused path leading into the
bowels of the cliff. They talked in whispers and
low tones. A loud voice would go rumbling off
in a weird way, not altogether comfortable to
listen to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I wouldn&rsquo;t much care to be trapped in
here,&rdquo; said Tubby, as they pressed on.</p>
<p>All at once the path they had been following
took a sudden dip. Right under their feet was
a narrow chasm. If they had not had lights
they might have been precipitated into it, but
luckily their lanterns showed them the peril just
in time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>For a short time it looked as if the treasure
hunt would have to end right there. There
seemed to be no means of crossing the chasm, and
they had brought none with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So near and yet so far,&rdquo; breathed Merritt.</p>
<p>But presently the major discovered a stout
plank resting against the wall of the passage.
It was worm-eaten and old, but a test showed it
would support them. It had evidently been left
there by the old buccaneer. It caused an odd
thrill to shoot through Rob, as he stepped upon
it, to reflect that the last foot to press it had
been in the tomb for many scores of years.</p>
<p>On the other side of the chasm the cave widened
out. In fact, it developed into quite a spacious
chamber. The rock walls, imbedded with
mica, glistened brightly in the yellow glow of
the lanterns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look like a convention of lightning bugs,&rdquo;
commented Tubby, gazing about him at the
unusual scene. The professor drew out a paper.
He and the major bent over it, while the others
listened breathlessly to ascertain the outcome of
this inspection of the plan of the long lost treasure
trove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;According to the plan the treasure is located
in this chamber,&rdquo; said the major at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; added the professor, &ldquo;the plan
does not give any further details of the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it extends further?&rdquo; inquired
Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible to say. Some of these caves and
their ramifications extend for many miles. When
the major has concluded his quest, I think it
would be of scientific interest to explore the subterranean
thoroughfares at length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All agreed with this view. But the present
business speedily banished all other thoughts
from their minds. Like so many hounds on the
scent, the boys ran about the place, seeking for
clews to the hiding place. But to their bitter disappointment
all their efforts resulted in nothing.
No trace of any hoarded stock of precious articles
could be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had better have something to eat and then
we can determine on our further course,&rdquo; said
the major, looking at his watch; &ldquo;I am convinced
that the treasure is here, however, and equally
positive we shall find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they sat down to their meal it was discovered
that, in their haste, they had forgotten
to bring any water. Tubby, Hiram and Jumbo
at once volunteered to fetch some in the canteens
which had been left in the canoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rsquo;m jes&rsquo; pinin&rsquo; ter see dat ole Massa Sol
once mo&rsquo;;&rdquo; confessed the negro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;you can be one
of the party, Jumbo. But hurry back, Hopkins,
for I am anxious to waste no more time than
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hurry,&rdquo; Tubby assured him.</p>
<p>The trio, the two boys and the black, hastened
off, retracing their steps through the dark passage
of the cavern. It was a distinct relief to
regain the sunlight and open air. So much so
that perhaps they lingered by the concealed
canoes rather longer than they should have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. We&rsquo;ve wasted enough time,&rdquo; said
Tubby at length; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s hurry back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set out at a good pace. But as they
pushed through the brush separating them from
the cliff; in the face of which was situated the
cave entrance, a sudden sound brought them to
an abrupt standstill. Tubby, who was in the
lead, raised his hand for silence.</p>
<p>In the hush that followed they could distinctly
catch the sound of voices ahead of them. At first
Tubby thought that they were those of some of
the party in the cave who had come out to see
what had become of them. But he was speedily
undeceived.</p>
<p>One of the voices struck suddenly on his ear
with an unpleasant shock. It was a harsh, grating
voice, and Tubby, to his dismay, recognized
it in a flash as being that of Stonington Hunt.
He had heard it too often to be mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all ready?&rdquo; Hunt was saying.</p>
<p>A sort of growl of assent followed these
words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can they be up to?&rdquo; asked Hiram, who
was also aware now of the identity of the voices
in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; rejoined Tubby in the same
low tones; &ldquo;as well as I can see, they are all on
that cliff top alongside those balanced stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what they are doing up there?&rdquo;
mused Hiram; &ldquo;I suppose that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was drowned in a loud crash as the
larger of two stones was pushed over the edge
of the cliff. In a flash Tubby perceived the
fiendish object of Stonington Hunt and his followers.</p>
<p>The great rock fell directly in front of the
opening of the cave. The way in or out of the
underground chamber was effectually blocked,
unless the obstruction was blasted with dynamite.</p>
<p>Cold chills ran up and down Tubby&rsquo;s spine.
Hiram shuddered and turned white, and Jumbo
groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh lawsy! lawsy! I knowed no good &rsquo;ud come
uv meddling wif dat ole dead teef&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; ordered Tubby, sternly. With
every nerve on the alert he watched Hunt peer
over the cliff-face. The next moment their enemy
retreated with a chuckle of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all sealed up good and tight,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let them stay in there a day or two
and then we&rsquo;ll blast the rock away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that fat kid will be thinner when he gets
out,&rdquo; Tubby heard Freeman Hunt say as his
father rejoined the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; thought the lad, &ldquo;&lsquo;that fat kid&rsquo; as
you call him is on the outside, Master Hunt. And
it&rsquo;s a good thing he is, for the outside is where
help will have to come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchers concealed in the brush below saw
a new figure join the group on the cliff summit,
a man with a great, bushy, black beard and
shifty black eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mah goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Jumbo; &ldquo;dat am
de pussonage who peeked frough dem bushes las&rsquo;
night. I thought I knowed him. Dat&rsquo;s Black
Bart, the sun-shiner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party at the cliff summit turned and vanished.
Apparently they had a camp up there
from which they had observed every movement
of the Boy Scout party. It was plain enough
now, since Jumbo&rsquo;s recognition, how they came
to be there. Black Bart must have overheard the
major discussing the plan the night before. By
making a forced march by night the rascals had
arrived ahead of the rightful searchers for the
old buccaneer&rsquo;s hoard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get back toward the boats before
they take a notion to investigate,&rdquo; said Tubby.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy sticking around here much
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Hiram; &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly knows ah&rsquo;m willin&rsquo;,&rdquo; breathed Jumbo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>Snugly hidden in the thick growth into which
the canoes had been dragged, the two Scouts and
the negro discussed the situation. It was a desperate
one. For the present, at least, Hunt and
his party dominated it. One unpleasant thought,
too, kept obtruding itself. The party in the
cave had no water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hunt says he won&rsquo;t blast it open for
two days, anyhow,&rdquo; put in Hiram; &ldquo;I suppose
he figures that the major would be too weak to
oppose him then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s it. What a rascal that Hunt
is! But what are we going to do to help them?
We can&rsquo;t move that rock, and we&rsquo;ve got nothing
to blast it away with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby&rsquo;s face showed the dismay, the almost
despair, that he felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what, Hiram,&rdquo; he said at length,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to take one of the canoes and get
off down the lake. When you reach the foot of
it make a dash to the westward, where there is
a village. I&rsquo;ll wait here with Jumbo till you return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will take two days, at least, maybe a
week,&rdquo; objected Hiram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped. We&rsquo;ve got to do something.
You are lighter and can travel quicker than I.
Take food and a rifle and get through as quick
as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the red canoe, well stocked
with food, and paddled by the young Scout, shot
out from the shore. By hugging the rim of the
lake the boys had figured that he would be able
to undertake the first stage of his journey without
running much risk of being seen by their
enemies. Besides, it was unlikely that Hunt or
his cronies would be keeping a very keen lookout
as they evidently believed that all the party was
imprisoned in the cave.</p>
<p>Tubby and Jumbo watched the canoe while it
remained in sight, and then returned to their
hiding place. Toward the middle of the afternoon
they saw smoke on the cliff top and well
back from the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; thought Tubby, &ldquo;they are
camped at a good distance back from us. I
reckon there&rsquo;s no danger of their seeing us moving
about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>With great caution the lad wormed his way
through the brush, leaving Jumbo to guard the
canoes. He had formed a daring determination
to examine the rock and see if it was not possible
in some miraculous way to move it. But an examination
confirmed his worst fears.</p>
<p>The great stone was as immovable as if it had
formed a part of the living rock. Tubby actually
gave a groan of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a thing we can do,&rdquo; he moaned
disconsolately. A sudden footfall above him
made him dive into the brush. He flattened out,
immovable, in a flash. The next instant Hunt
strode into the glade, followed by his son. They
also examined the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they won&rsquo;t come to our terms,&rdquo; said Hunt,
as they turned away again, &ldquo;we can immure
them in a living tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby Hopkins, lying as quiet as a rabbit in
his place of concealment, could not but feel the
bitter truth the words held.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows are a long time getting that
water, and I&rsquo;m as dry as a jar of salt,&rdquo; said Merritt,
as they munched on their provisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re all pretty thirsty,&rdquo; said the
major. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better go and hurry them
up, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt sprinted off on this errand. He had
almost reached the ravine and was about to step
on the narrow bridge across it when there was
a sudden crashing jar that shook the earth.</p>
<p>Though, of course, he did not know it, the
noise was occasioned by the falling rock dislodged
by Hunt and his followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what that was?&rdquo; thought the boy,
little guessing the real cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were in the west I should think it was
an earthquake. But I never heard of any in
the Adirondacks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>Before long he gained a point in the passage
where he knew he should have seen a disc of
daylight ahead of him. Puzzled by its absence,
the boy pushed on. Every minute he expected
to see the light, but the darkness continued to
prevail. Sorely perplexed, he took a few steps
more, when he was abruptly confronted by a
mass of solid rock. The passage appeared to
have terminated.</p>
<p>It was several moments before the meaning of
this conveyed itself to the boy&rsquo;s mind. When he
mastered the situation it was with a sense of
shock that for an instant almost deprived him
of his senses.</p>
<p>Recovering his wits he lost no time in communicating
his alarming intelligence. Incidentally,
the cause of the noise he had heard was
abundantly explained.</p>
<p>It required but a brief examination by the
major, to make known the full extent of their
calamity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are walled in,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no hope of escape?&rdquo; gasped the professor.
The boys were too much overcome to
speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>The major shook his head. Unconsciously he
repeated Tubby&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help, if it is to come, must come from the
outside,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>His words rang hollowly in the musty, subterranean
passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">TWO COLUMNS OF SMOKE.</span></h2>
<p>Through the deep woods a boyish figure was
creeping. It was Hiram, footsore, sick and despondent.
It was the second day since he had
left the scene of the Boy Scouts&rsquo; misfortune. Behind
him lay the lake. And that was about all
he knew definitely of his situation.</p>
<p>For the last hour of his slow progress over
the cruelly rough ground, the lad&rsquo;s heart had almost
failed him. But he had kept pluckily on.
At last, though, he was compelled, from sheer
exhaustion, to sink down under a big hickory
tree. He was lost, hopelessly lost in the midst
of the Adirondack wilds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>Few men or boys who have ever been in a
similar fix will not realize the extreme danger
of Hiram&rsquo;s position. There are still vast tracks
in these mountains untrodden, except, perchance,
at long intervals, by the foot of man. The predicament
of one who misses his way in their
lonely stretches is serious indeed. Hiram was a
nervous, sensitive boy, moreover, and, as the
dark shadows of late afternoon began to steal
through the woods, he felt a sense of keen fear,
and alarm. He even thought he could make out
the forms of savage beasts prowling about him.</p>
<p>At last the boy determined, by a brave effort, to
make the best of it. He ate a meal of bread and
salt meat from his haversack and washed it down
with water from his canteen. Then he set himself
to thinking about a way out of his position.</p>
<p>But as is often the case with those hopelessly
lost in the wilderness, his brain refused to work
coherently. A sort of panic had clutched him.
To his excited, overwrought imagination it appeared
that it was his fate, his destiny to die
alone in these great, silent woods, stretching, for
all he knew, to infinity on every side of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must brace up and do something,&rdquo; thought
Hiram desperately; &ldquo;maybe I haven&rsquo;t wandered
as far as I think. Perhaps a signal fire might
be seen by somebody. I&rsquo;ll try it, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of doing something cheered him
mightily. The task of gathering wood and bark
to make his fire also helped to keep his mind
off his predicament.</p>
<p>The young Scout built his fire on the summit
of the highest bit of ground he could find. It
was a bare hillock, rocky and bleak, rising amid
the trees.</p>
<p>The fire Hiram constructed was, properly
speaking, composed of two piles of sticks and dry
leaves and bark. Close at hand he piled a big
armful of extra fuel to keep it going. For he
had determined to watch by the fires all night, if
necessary. It was, he felt, his last hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>The fires arranged to his satisfaction, the boy
set a match to each pile in turn. From the midst
of the forest two columns of smoke ascended.
The afternoon was still. Not a breath of wind
ruffled a leaf. In the calm air the columns of
smoke shot up straight. Hiram piled green
leaves on his blazing heaps and the smoke grew
thicker.</p>
<p>The message the two smoke columns spelled
out, in Scout talk, was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am lost, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram knew if there were any Scouts within
seeing distance of the two smoke columns, that
he would be saved. If not&mdash;but he did not dare
to dwell on that thought.</p>
<p>The late afternoon deepened into twilight, and
still Hiram sat on, feeding his fires, although
the flames of hope in his heart had died out into
gray ashes of despair. As the darkness thickened
and a gloom spread through the woods, his
fears and nervousness increased. It is one thing
to have a companion in the woods and the surety
of a camp fire and comfort at night, and quite
another pair of shoes to be lost in the impenetrable
forest. Anybody who has experienced the
dilemma can appreciate something of poor
Hiram&rsquo;s state of mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>It grew almost dark. The two fires glowed in
the twilight like two red eyes.</p>
<p>All at once Hiram almost uttered a shout of
alarm. Then he grew still, his heart beating till
it shook his frame. Somewhere, close to him, a
twig had cracked. He was certain, too, that he
had seen a dark form dodge behind a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; he cried shrilly.</p>
<p>As if in reply, from behind the surrounding
trees, a dozen dark forms suddenly emerged and
started toward him. Half beside himself with
alarm, Hiram, his mind full of visions of moonshiners,
Indians and desperadoes, leaped to his
feet and started to run for his life.</p>
<p>But he had not gone a dozen steps before he
stumbled and fell. As he did so his head struck
a rock and the blow stunned him.</p>
<p>The men who had emerged with such suddenness
from behind the trees hastened up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t have feared a trap,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;it
was a genuine Scout signal. I&rsquo;m glad my boys
taught them to me or we might have been too
late to save this boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was the same man who had recognized
Rob Blake, and whose two sons were members
of the Curlew Patrol. He picked Hiram up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost and half scared to death,&rdquo; he said tenderly;
&ldquo;and just to think that we crept up on
him like a bunch of prowling Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to look out for traps, you
know,&rdquo; put in the leader, the gray-moustached
man; &ldquo;those two smoke columns that you knew
the meaning of might have been a trick to decoy
us. I&rsquo;m glad we approached stealthily, but I&rsquo;m
sorry we scared this poor kid so badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be all right directly,&rdquo; was the easy
reply. &ldquo;Sam, you and Jim get a kettle boiling
and make coffee. We&rsquo;ll camp here to-night,&rdquo;
said Rob&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>He set Hiram down at the root of a big tree
just as the lad opened his eyes and gazed with
astonishment on the group of stalwart, kind-eyed
men gathered in wonderment about him.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It was moonlight, and almost midnight, before
Tubby deemed it safe to reconnoitre the vicinity
of the cave mouth. Followed by Jumbo, who was
quaking with fear, but accompanied the stout
youth in preference to being left alone, Tubby
cautiously made his way through the undergrowth.
A spot of bright light above showed
him the location of the camp fire of Hunt&rsquo;s gang.
It was hardly likely that they would be patroling
the entrance to the cave, effectually blocked as
it was. But Tubby took no chances. With the
skill and silence of an Indian he wormed his way
along.</p>
<p>He had almost reached the open space where
they had chopped down the brush when, without
an instant&rsquo;s warning, the figure of Stonington
Hunt strode into view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>At the same unlucky instant Jumbo, lumbering
along quite silently, stubbed his toe against an
out-cropping rock. He fell headlong with a
crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gollygumptions! I&rsquo;m killed dead!&rdquo; he yelled
at the top of his lungs, utterly regardless of consequences.</p>
<p>Tubby turned and was about to dodge back
into the shelter of the dense growth when Hunt
espied him. With an angry oath he sprang at
him, pointing a pistol. But Tubby, in a flash,
changed his tactics surprisingly. Converting
himself into a human battering ram, he lowered
his head and rushed full tilt at Hunt.</p>
<p>Completely taken by surprise by Tubby&rsquo;s onslaught,
Hunt stopped and hesitated. The fat
boy, at the same instant, rushed between the
man&rsquo;s legs, seizing them in a firm grip as he did
so. The unexpected assault resulted in hurling
Hunt violently forward. He fell sprawling in a
heap. At the same instant his pistol was discharged
in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>As the report rang out from close at hand half
a dozen figures sprang into being. They were
those of his followers who had been behind him
at some distance on this nocturnal visit of inspection.</p>
<p>Dale and Bumpus instantly recognized Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fat kid who wrecked our sloop!&rdquo;
cried Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred dollars to the one that gets him!&rdquo;
shouted Hunt from the ground where he still lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How under the sun did he escape?&rdquo; shouted
Freeman Hunt, taking up the chorus of cries and
exclamations.</p>
<p>But before Dale, agile as he was, could reach
him, Tubby had darted nimbly off. He was heading
for the bushes. In another instant he would
have reached them but a second figure suddenly
dodged into the moonlight and blocked his way.
It was Black Bart. He outspread his long arms
to catch the hunted youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>The next instant he had shared Hunt&rsquo;s fate.
Tubby, for the second time that night, executed
his skillful tackle. Black Bart, with a string of
bad words accompanying his fall, was upset
without ceremony. But Dale was close on Tubby&rsquo;s
nimble heels. As the lad dodged from his
fallen foe Dale reached out, and his big hand
grabbed the fleeing lad&rsquo;s collar. Tubby gave a
dive and a twist but he could not get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Dale. Hold him!&rdquo; came Freeman
Hunt&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Suddenly another figure appeared. The newcomer
sprang out of the shadows behind them.
With one blow this personage knocked Dale
sprawling beside Black Bart, and the next instant,
as Pete Bumpus essayed to take part in
the fray, he was sent to join the other two.</p>
<p>Tubby felt himself snatched up and carried
swiftly off into the darkness of the friendly
brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gollygumptions!&rdquo; chuckled Jumbo, for it was
he, as he ran, &ldquo;but it shuah did feel good to swat
dem no-good trash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Jumbo, is that you?&rdquo; asked Tubby as
he heard; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive you for almost getting
us captured.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tank you, Marse Hopkins,&rdquo; rejoined Jumbo
gravely; &ldquo;but we bes&rsquo; keep our words till we get
furder away. Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind them they could hear angry voices, and
shouts and trampling in the brush.</p>
<p>The strong-muscled black, bent almost double,
ran swiftly with his burden for some distance
further. Then he set Tubby down and rested,
breathing heavily. The sounds of the chase
came from afar to them, much fainter now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; chortled Jumbo; &ldquo;dey look an&rsquo; look,
but dey no find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, too, Jumbo,&rdquo; said Tubby, sitting
down on a decayed log; &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t help
to get the major and the rest out of that hole in
the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Marse Hiram got frough,&rdquo; suggested
Jumbo hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Tubby with a
mournful intonation; &ldquo;it looks now as if that was
our only chance of saving them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; added Tubby, suddenly gazing
about him. There was something familiar
about the scenery. Especially about a tall, cone-shaped
rock that loomed up close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ruby Glow!&rdquo; he exclaimed the next
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gollygumptions, ef dere ain&rsquo;t a spook or
suthin&rsquo; on top of it,&rdquo; cried Jumbo.</p>
<p>He pointed to a dark figure standing upright
in the white moonlight that flooded the isolated
mass of rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">THE HEART OF THE MYSTERY&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>We left the major and his party marooned in
the cave, and overcome by the suddenness of the
disaster that had overtaken them like a bolt from
a clear sky. We must now return to them.</p>
<p>After the first shock of the discovery the
major suggested that they retreat to the chamber
and talk things over as calmly as possible. Each
one of the party, with a strong effort to master
his feelings, followed the advice. A long consultation
followed, the result of which was that they
determined that the first thing to be done was
to institute a search for water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>The far end of the cavern had not yet been
explored and it was decided to begin with that.
Headed by the major, they started for what
seemed a blank wall at the end of the chamber.
But on nearing it, it proved that its appearance
of blankness was chiefly caused by a sort of
screen of rock that masked an opening as effectually
as if it had been placed there by someone
anxious to conceal it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll penetrate beyond this,&rdquo; announced the
major, and holding his lantern high, was stepping
forward when he stopped. One word came
to his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a tiny rift in the rock, sure enough, a
small but blessed stream of clear water was flowing.
The delight with which the imprisoned
party hailed the discovery may be imagined. For
a short time, while they assuaged their pangs of
thirst, already painful, they almost forgot the
seriousness of their situation.</p>
<p>While the others drank, Andy Bowles, who
had been one of the first to taste the cool water,
strayed further into the passage. Presently his
voice was borne back to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a funny sort of box
in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a box?&rdquo; hailed the major, alert
in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s awful old by the looks of it. It&rsquo;s
all bound with iron, and nails are stuck all over
it. And&mdash;say! There are two more back beyond
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treasure trove!&rdquo; gasped the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond a doubt,&rdquo; said the major. Then he
added gloomily, &ldquo;but what good is it to us now?
If we cannot escape from here before long we
shall perish miserably, and nothing but dynamite
can release us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate we must not give up hope,&rdquo; counselled
the professor; &ldquo;suppose we investigate
these boxes. At any rate it will give us something
to do. It is better than doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; declared the major; &ldquo;it may
keep us from dwelling on the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt&rsquo;s axe was called into requisition, and,
as the others stood round with upraised lanterns,
the boy swung the weapon down on the iron lock
of the first of the old chests. It was old and rotten,
and, after a few blows, it gave way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>With trembling, nervous hands the lid of the
box was pushed back. But a surprise greeted
the fortune hunters. Instead of a mass of gold
objects or coins meeting their eyes only a faded
piece of red velvet, covering the contents of the
box, met their gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull it off!&rdquo; ordered the major.</p>
<p>Merritt and the professor raised the bit of fabric
and then started back with startled faces.
Under the velvet was a picture. A grim portrait
of a tall man in black garments holding a skull
in his hands, while he knelt beside an open grave.
Under it was painted in old fashioned letters:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;The End Of The Quest for Riches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; exclaimed the major, who
had paled a little under his tan, &ldquo;that seems
almost like a warning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>Mastering a feeling of dread, Merritt helped
the professor to raise the picture. Under it was
an old sea cloak, a brass spy glass of antique
make, and an old-fashioned compass and&mdash;that
was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It begins to look as if my ancestor had played
a grim joke on posterity,&rdquo; said the major; &ldquo;however,
let us see what is in the other two boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crash!</p>
<p>Down came Merritt&rsquo;s axe on the first of the
remaining two chests. The lid flew open with
such suddenness that it startled them. It was
operated by concealed springs.</p>
<p>As the light of the lanterns fell on the contents
of this box, however, all doubt as to the
success of the quest was removed. It was filled
to the brim with golden candlesticks, vases,
plates and cups of priceless value. Some of them
flashed with gems. The hoarded treasure of the
wicked old pirate of the Spanish seas lay before
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the other,&rdquo; said the professor in a faint
voice, &ldquo;I can hardly believe my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem incredible,&rdquo; commented the
major.</p>
<p>The contents of the other chest, which was
speedily opened, proved to be of the same nature
as that of the second one rifled. On the interior
of the lid, however, there had been a secret chamber.
The spring of this, rotten with age, gave
way as the cover was lifted. A niagara of coins
of all nations, Spanish doubloons, French crowns,
English Rose nobles and florins, and queerly-marked
Oriental wealth, flowed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should you think was the value of all
this, professor?&rdquo; asked the major when he recovered
his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least two million dollars,&rdquo; was the rejoinder
in tones the man of science tried in vain
to render steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give half of it now if we could get out
of here,&rdquo; said the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there is a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Merritt who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so, my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, while we&rsquo;ve been standing here I&rsquo;ve noticed
a draught. Look at the lantern flames
flicker in it. It comes from further down the
passage. We might explore it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; said the major, and followed
by the others, still dazed by the sight of the
hoarded fortune, he struck out into the darkness.
For some distance the passage into which he had
plunged was level. Then his feet encountered
rough steps. Calling to the others to follow him
the major mounted them.</p>
<p>Up and up they climbed, the wind blowing
more freshly in their faces every instant. All at
once, without any warning, the major emerged
into the open air. He looked about him amazed.
The others, as they joined him, heard his astonishment.
They seemed to be on the summit of a
small island in the midst of a sea of woods.</p>
<p>Gazing over the edge, they soon ascertained
that they were at the summit of a high cone-shaped
mass of rocks. The sides were steep as
church walls, and offered no foothold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>All at once the explanation burst upon the
major. &ldquo;We are at the summit of Ruby Glow!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>
<p>Astonishing as it appeared, this was the truth.
The professor regarded it as a proof of his theory
that the place had been used as an Indian
watch tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know now what puzzled me before,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and that was the manner in which they
gained the summit of the cone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t help us to get down,&rdquo; said
Merritt, &ldquo;it looks as if we are as badly off as
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said the major; &ldquo;no
living being could scale those walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no living being could move that rock
from the entrance to the cave,&rdquo; echoed Rob miserably.</p>
<p>They retraced their steps. The hours passed
slowly in the cavern. But in order to employ
them somehow they made an inventory of the
contents of the treasure boxes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>Supper was eaten from their fast diminishing
store of eatables. Nobody talked much. They
did not feel inclined for conversation. At length
nature asserted itself. Rob actually began to
feel sleepy. Andy and the professor had already
flung themselves down and were fast asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll take one more look out from Ruby
Glow before I turn in,&rdquo; thought Rob to himself.</p>
<p>With this intention in mind he left the cave.
He did not take long to reach the top of the cone.
Moonlight flooded it, and the surrounding forest.
Rob looked about him. It was a lovely scene, but
somehow its beauty didn&rsquo;t impress him much just
then. All at once he became aware of two figures
below the cone gazing curiously up at it.
One was oddly familiar to him. In fact they
both were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked, feeling that there was
no danger in speaking clearly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; came up the answer in Tubby&rsquo;s voice,
in a low, but penetrating whisper, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me,
Tubby. Jumbo&rsquo;s with me. How under the canopy
did you get up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; responded Rob, in the same
cautious tones; &ldquo;the question is how are we going
to get down again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! that&rsquo;s so. There&rsquo;s no way of clambering
down the sides. If only we had a rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got one. The canoe ropes joined together
would be long and strong enough,&rdquo; said
Rob, &ldquo;but how could you get them up to us? No
trees grow close enough. I don&rsquo;t see how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short. Tubby had suddenly begun
to execute a grotesque sort of war-dance. His
figure capered oddly about in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait there till I come back!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
and suddenly darted off, followed by Jumbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that isn&rsquo;t just like Tubby,&rdquo; said Rob;
&ldquo;what in the world is he up to now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rob knew Tubby well enough to divine
that the lad would not have told him to wait if
there had not been some good reason for it. So
he sat down with what patience he could. It was
some time before Tubby reappeared. When he
did, he had something in his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; he cried to Rob.</p>
<p>The leader of the Eagle Patrol watched his
Scout carefully. Suddenly he realized what
Tubby was doing. He had made a bow and
arrow out of springy wood. Then he had attached
one end of a light string to the arrow. To
the other extremity of the string, which was long
enough to reach the summit of the cone, was
attached the knotted lengths of canoe and pack
rope. Rob had hardly time to take in the details
of this clever trick before the arrow came whizzing
by his ear. He grabbed the string as it followed
and began hauling in.</p>
<p>Before long he had reached its end, and started
pulling on the rope. He made one end fast about
a projecting pinnacle of rock, and then called
down his congratulations to Tubby in a low but
hearty voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I always told you I could do something else
than fall in,&rdquo; was the message Tubby sent back
as he strutted about below.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s next act was to arouse the sleepers and
Major Dangerfield. They were all naturally
warm in praise of Tubby&rsquo;s clever device. It was
tested by Rob who slid down it in perfect safety,
but landed with barked shins and scraped hands.
That was a cheap price to pay for deliverance,
though, and the others, when they followed him,
felt the same way about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what are we going to do?&rdquo; said the major
as they all stood in a group on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the professor.</p>
<p>But the words were taken out of his mouth.
Rob made a hasty sign to the others to conceal
themselves. A sudden heavy rumbling sound
had echoed through the air. It was followed by
a red flash from the direction of the mouth of the
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve blown the rock up!&rdquo; cried the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they were all prowling around
there to-night, I suppose,&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to the canoes and arm ourselves,&rdquo;
said the major; &ldquo;we can catch them all red-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First the rope by which they had escaped was
cut as high as possible from the ground, and then
the major&rsquo;s suggestion was carried out. They
reached the entrance of the cave just in time to
hear footsteps approaching down the passage.</p>
<p>They crouched quietly till Dale emerged from
the cavern entrance, stumbling over the shattered
fragments of the big rock that had blocked
it. His arms were full of plunder from the
chests, and he was able to offer little resistance.
He was seized and bound and gagged without
his having any opportunity to make an outcry.
One after another, as they came out, the rest of
Hunt&rsquo;s gang were served the same way. Hunt
and his son, however, in some manner became
alarmed as they neared the entry. They dashed
back, outfooting the lads who pursued them.
Down the passage they fled and stumbled blindly,
in their fear, along the further passage and up
the steps to the top of the Ruby Glow peak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>Arriving here they spied the rope. In a flash
they were over the edge and down it. Although
they had bad tumbles when they reached the part
where it had been cut off, they managed to make
good their escape. It would have been folly to
pursue them in the woods at night.</p>
<p>Black Bart&rsquo;s capture deserves some mention.
It was effected by Jumbo, who literally threw
himself on the black-bearded man as he emerged.
It was probably the noise of this scuffle that
alarmed Hunt and his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You looks like five hundred dollahs to muh,&rdquo;
grinned Jumbo, as Black Bart, sullen and defiant
as a wild cat, was manacled.</p>
<p>The remainder of that night was spent in the
cave, the prisoners being closely guarded. The
next day Dale was induced to tell how they had
stolen the explosive from the hut of an eccentric
old character who did some experimental mining
not far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We figgered we&rsquo;d find some use for it,&rdquo; he
said cheerfully.</p>
<p>That day was occupied in packing the precious
articles, in bags brought for the purpose. By
evening all was complete. If they had known
how Hiram was faring they would have felt perfectly
content. It was decided, if he did not reappear,
to leave some of the party in camp to
await his return, while the others pushed on to
give the prisoners up to the proper authorities.</p>
<p>But at midnight that night they had a great
surprise. Rob, who was on watch, heard a sudden
hail out of the darkness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;K-r-r-r-e-e-e-e!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the cry of the Eagle Patrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can be giving it, I wonder,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>The next minute he knew. Hiram and the
revenue officers, who had made a night march
of it, burst in upon the camp. Hiram had, in his
wanderings, retraced much of his way back toward
the camp so that they had not had so very
far to tramp. The officials were delighted to
learn of the clever manner in which the moonshiners
had been apprehended. They had been
searching for Black Bart, when they sighted
Hiram&rsquo;s signal fires.</p>
<p>Jumbo was assured that his five hundred dollars
would be awarded to him at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Had we space, or opportunity, we would like
to tell of the journey back to civilization, of the
share that each Boy Scout, much against his inclination,
was forced to accept of the treasure,
and of Alice Dangerfield&rsquo;s thanks to the Boy
Scouts for the brave way in which they stood by
her father in time of peril. They really valued
this&mdash;like true Scouts&mdash;more than the monetary
reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>But further adventures impend in the Boy
Scouts&rsquo; eventful lives,&mdash;exciting, as well as
amusing, incidents &ldquo;by flood and field.&rdquo;  If our
readers care to follow further the careers of our
young friends, they can find them set forth in
detail in the next volume of this series:</p>

<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR RANGERS&rsquo; CLOUD CRUISER.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>From the &ldquo;Nomad&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Discoverer&rdquo; from the sea to
the sky, the scene changes in which the Motor Rangers figure.
They have experiences &ldquo;that never were on land or sea,&rdquo;
in heat and cold and storm, over mountain peak and lost
city, with savages and reptiles; their ship of the air is attacked
by huge birds of the air; they survive explosion and
earthquake; they even live to tell the tale!</dd></dl>

<h3 title="">MOLLY BROWN SERIES</h3>
<p class="center">College Life Stories for Girls
<br />By NELL SPEED.</p>
<p class="center">Cloth Bound. Illustrated. Price, 60c. per vol., postpaid</p>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>MOLLY BROWN&rsquo;S FRESHMAN DAYS.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>Would you like to admit to your
circle of friends the most charming
of college girls&mdash;the typical college
girl for whom we are always looking
but not always finding; the type
that contains so many delightful
characteristics, yet without unpleasant
perfection in any; the
natural, unaffected, sweet-tempered
girl, loved because she is lovable?
Then seek an introduction to Molly
Brown. You will find the baggage-master, the cook, the
Professor of English Literature, and the College President
in the same company.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>MOLLY BROWN&rsquo;S SOPHOMORE DAYS.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>What is more delightful than a re-union of college girls
after the summer vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience&mdash;at least, if all class-mates
are as happy together as the Wellington girls of this
story. Among Molly&rsquo;s interesting friends of the second
year is a young Japanese girl, who ingratiates her &ldquo;humbly&rdquo;
self into everybody&rsquo;s affections speedily and permanently.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>MOLLY BROWN&rsquo;S JUNIOR DAYS.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>Financial stumbling blocks are not the only things that
hinder the ease and increase the strength of college girls.
Their troubles and their triumphs are their own, often
peculiar to their environment. How Wellington students
meet the experiences outside the class-rooms is worth the
doing, the telling and the reading.</dd></dl>

<h3 title="">MOTOR MAIDS SERIES</h3>
<p class="center">Wholesome Stories of Adventure
<br />By KATHERINE STOKES.</p>
<p class="center">Cloth Bound. Illustrated. Price, 50c. per vol., postpaid</p>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR MAIDS&rsquo; SCHOOL DAYS.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>Billie Campbell was just the type
of a straightforward, athletic girl
to be successful as a practical
Motor Maid. She took her car, as
she did her class-mates, to her
heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together. The
road over which she ran her
red machine had many an unexpected
turning,&mdash;now it led her
into peculiar danger; now into contact
with strange travelers; and again into experiences
by fire and water. But, best of all, &ldquo;The Comet&rdquo; never
failed its brave girl owner.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times,
for these were companionable girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full of unique adventures&mdash;and
so, of course, they found them.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully
entertaining to see old scenes through fresh eyes. It is
that privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join
the Motor Maids in their first &rsquo;cross-country run.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND HEATHER.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor
could their education by travel have been more wisely
begun. But now a speaking acquaintance with their own
country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to
the British Isles. How they made their polite American
bow and how they were received on the other side is a
tale of interest and inspiration.</dd></dl>

<h3 title="">GIRL AVIATORS SERIES</h3>
<p class="center">Clean Aviation Stories
<br />By MARGARET BURNHAM.</p>
<p class="center">Cloth Bound. Illustrated. Price, 50c. per vol., postpaid</p>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE GIRL AVIATORS AND THE PHANTOM AIRSHIP.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>Roy Prescott was fortunate in
having a sister so clever and devoted
to him and his interests that
they could share work and play
with mutual pleasure and to mutual
advantage. This proved especially
true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their aeroplane,
and Peggy won well deserved
fame for her skill and good
sense as an aviator. There were
many stumbling-blocks in their terrestrial path, but they
soared above them all to ultimate success.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that
wins and holds girl enthusiasts as well as boys is proved
by this tale. On golden wings the girl aviators rose for
many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE GIRL AVIATORS&rsquo; SKY CRUISE.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure.
How much more perilous an adventure a &ldquo;sky
cruise&rdquo; might be is suggested by the title and proved by
the story itself.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE GIRL AVIATORS&rsquo; MOTOR BUTTERFLY.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>The delicacy of flight suggested by the word &ldquo;butterfly,&rdquo;
the mechanical power implied by &ldquo;motor,&rdquo; the ability to
control assured in the title &ldquo;aviator,&rdquo; all combined with
the personality and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make
this story one for any girl or other reader &ldquo;to go crazy
over.&rdquo;</dd></dl>

<h3 title="">MOTOR CYCLE SERIES</h3>
<p class="center">Splendid Motor Cycle Stories
<br />By LIEUT. HOWARD PAYSON.
<br />Author of &ldquo;Boy Scout Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">Cloth Bound. Illustrated. Price, 50c. per vol., postpaid</p>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS AROUND THE WORLD.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>Could Jules Verne have dreamed
of encircling the globe with a motor
cycle for emergencies he would have
deemed it an achievement greater
than any he describes in his account
of the amusing travels of Phileas
Fogg. This, however, is the purpose
successfully carried out by the Motor
Cycle Chums, and the tale of their
mishaps, hindrances and delays is
one of intense interest, secret amusement,
and incidental information to
the reader.</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS OF THE NORTHWEST PATROL.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities
and in it the Motor Cycle Chums meet adventures even
more unusual and exciting than many of their experiences
on their tour around the world. There is not a dull page
in this lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant
&ldquo;Chinee.&rdquo;</dd></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dt>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS IN THE GOLD FIELDS.</dt></dl>
<dl class="bcat"><dd>The gold fever which ran its rapid course through the
veins of the historic &ldquo;forty-niners&rdquo; recurs at certain intervals,
and seizes its victims with almost irresistible
power. The search for gold is so fascinating to the
seekers that hardship, danger and failure are obstacles
that scarcely dampen their ardour. How the Motor Cycle
Chums were caught by the lure of the gold and into what
difficulties and novel experiences they were led, makes a
tale of thrilling interest.</dd></dl>
